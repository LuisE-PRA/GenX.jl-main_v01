24 | -->
25 | 
26 | ## Checklist
27 | 
28 | - [ ] Code changes are sufficiently documented; i.e. new functions contain docstrings and .md files under /docs/src have been updated if necessary.
29 | - [ ] The latest changes on the target branch have been incorporated, so that any conflicts are taken care of before merging. This can be accomplished either by merging in the target branch (e.g. 'git merge develop') or by rebasing on top of the target branch (e.g. 'git rebase develop'). Please do not hesitate to reach out to the GenX development team if you need help with this.
30 | - [ ] Code has been tested to ensure all functionality works as intended.
31 | - [ ] CHANGELOG.md has been updated (if this is a 'notable' change).
32 | - [ ] I consent to the release of this PR's code under the GNU General Public license.
33 | 
34 | ## How this can be tested
35 | 
36 | <!--
37 | If applicable: What cases should we try before/after? Will this alter any outputs, or is it a strictly internal change?
38 | -->
39 | 
40 | <!--
41 |   For Work In Progress Pull Requests, please use the Draft PR feature,
42 |   see https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/ for further details.
43 |   
44 |   For a timely review/response, please avoid force-pushing additional
45 |   commits if your PR already received reviews or comments.
46 |   After the PR is approved we will give you a chance to tidy up the branch before merging.
47 |   
48 |   Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure you've done the following:
49 |   - 👷‍♀️ Create small PRs. In most cases, this will be possible. In the case of large feature or module additions, it is best to work towards a "minimum viable product" that is thoroughly tested but may not have all desired functionality or features, make a PR for this, and then later work to add more features.
50 |   - 📝 Use descriptive commit messages.
51 |   - 📗 Update any related documentation.
52 | 
53 | -->
54 | 
55 | ## Post-approval checklist for GenX core developers
56 | After the PR is approved
57 | 
58 | - [ ] Check that the latest changes on the target branch are incorporated, either via merge or rebase
59 | - [ ] Remember to squash and merge if incorporating into develop

 77 | - Typo in HydrogenMinimumProduction setting key (#746)
 78 | - Default value of `Cap_Size` attribute for thermal generators (#747)
 79 | - Text to doc pages for retrofits (#730)
 80 | 
 81 | ### Changed
 82 | - Generalized the cHourlyMatching constraint in electrolyzer.jl and implemented it similarly 
 83 | to the other policies, making it easier for developers to add further contributions 
 84 | to the constraint (#725).
 85 | 
 86 | ## [0.4.0] - 2024-03-18
 87 | 
 88 | ### Added
 89 | - Feature CO2 and fuel module (#536)
 90 |   Adds a fuel module which enables modeling of fuel usage via (1) a constant heat rate and (2)
 91 |   piecewise-linear approximation of heat rate curves.
 92 |   Adds a CO2 module that determines the CO2 emissions based on fuel consumption, CO2 capture
 93 |   fraction, and whether the feedstock is biomass.
 94 | - Enable thermal power plants to burn multiple fuels (#586)
 95 | - Feature electrolysis basic (#525)
 96 |   Adds hydrogen electrolyzer model which enables the addition of hydrogen electrolyzer
 97 |   demands along with optional clean supply constraints.

109 | - Add functions to compute conflicting constraints when model is infeasible if supported by the solver (#624).
110 | - New settings parameter, VirtualChargeDischargeCost to test script and VREStor example case. The PR 608 attempts to
111 |   introduce this parameter as cost of virtual charging and discharging to avoid unusual results (#608).
112 | - New settings parameter, StorageVirtualDischarge, to turn storage virtual charging and discharging off if desired by the user (#638).
113 | - Add module to retrofit existing resources with new technologies (#600).
114 | - Formatted the code and added a format check to the CI pipeline (#673).

129 | - Fix docstring in energy_share_requirement.jl (#692)
130 | - Set MUST_RUN=1 for RealSystemExample/small_hydro plants (#517).
131 |   Previously these plants had no resource flag set, and so they did not contribute to the power balance.
132 |   As these plants are now useful, the objective in these cases is slightly lower.
133 | - Assign correct investment cost per stage in objective function initialization for multi-stage runs (#530)
134 | - Fix name of Fixed_OM_Cost_Charge_per_MWyr when reading from Generators_data in multistage code. (#533)

142 | - Fix scaling of transmission losses in write_transmission_losses.jl (#621)
143 | - Fix cost assignment to virtual storage charge/discharge - issue #604 (#608)
144 | - Fix modeling of hydro reservoir with long duration storage (#572).
145 | - Fix update of starting transmission capacity in multistage GenX
146 | - Fix write_status with UCommit = WriteShadowPrices = 1 (#645)

148 | - Updated the docstring for the initialize_cost_to_go function and adjusted the formula for the discount factor to reflect the code implementation (#672).
149 | - Fix write_multi_stage_cost.jl: add discount with OPEX multipliers to cUnmetPolicyPenalty (#679)
150 | - Fix DF calculation in DDP to make it more generic for variable length stages (#680)
151 | - Fix write_power_balance.jl: add additional two columns ("VRE_Storage_Discharge" and "VRE_Storage_Charge") for VRE_STOR
152 | 
153 | ### Changed
154 | - Use add_to_expression! instead of the += and -= operators for memory performance improvements (#498).
155 | - Generally, 'demand' is now used where (electrical) 'load' was used previously (#397).
156 | - `Load_data.csv` is being renamed to `Demand_data.csv`.
157 | - `Load_MW_z*` columns in that file are renamed to `Demand_MW_z*`.
158 | - In `Reserves.csv`, `Reg_Req_Percent_Load` and `Rsv_Req_Percent_Load` are renamed to `..._Demand`.
159 | - `Load` and `LoadWeight` keys in the `time_domain_reduction_settings.yml` file are renamed to `Demand`, `DemandWeight`.
160 | - The `New_Build` column in `Generators_data.csv` has been separated into two: `New_Build` and `Can_Retire` (#392).
161 |   Values in each column are {0,1}.
162 | - Separate proprietary JuMP solvers from the GenX package.
163 |   This allows users of Gurobi or CPLEX to use them without modifying
164 |   the source code of the GenX package directly. This is a key step in publishing
165 |   GenX as a proper Julia package. This does require change to the Run.jl files,
166 |   to specify the solver. (#531)
167 | - In the examples, change Reg_Max and Rsv_Max of any MUST_RUN generators to 0.
168 |   This mitigates but does not fully fix (#576).
169 | - Expressions of virtual charging and discharging costs in storage_all.jl and vre_stor.jl
170 | - The input file `Generators_data.csv` has been split into different files, one for each type of generator.
171 |   The new files are: `Thermal.csv`, `Hydro.csv`, `Vre.csv`, `Storage.csv`, `Flex_demand.csv`, `Must_run.csv`,
172 |   `Electrolyzer.csv`, and `Vre_stor.csv`. The examples have been updated, and new tests have been added to
173 |   check the new data format (#612).
174 | - The settings parameter `Reserves` has been renamed to `OperationalReserves`, `Reserves.csv` to
175 |   `Operational_reserves.csv`, and the `.jl` files contain the word `reserves` have been renamed to
176 |   `operational_reserves` (#641).
177 | - New folder structure for a GenX case. The input files are now organized in the following folders: `settings`, 
178 |   `policies`, `resources` and `system`. The examples and tests have been updated to reflect this change. 
179 | - New folder structure implemented for `example_system`. This folder now consists of nine separate folders each pertaining to a different case study example,
180 |   ranging from the ISONE three zones, with singlestage, multistage, electrolyzers, all the way to the 9 bus IEEE case for running DC-OPF.
181 | - Pruned HiGHS solver settings to the necessary minimum (#668)
182 | - Changed deploydoc URL to GenX.jl (#662)
183 | 
184 | ### Deprecated
185 | - The above `load` keys, which generally refer to electrical demand, are being deprecated.
186 |   Users should update their case files.
187 |   For now this is done in a backward-compatible manner, and @info reminders are written to the log to prompt the user to update.
188 |   "Load" now typically refers only to the transferrence of data from files to memory,
189 |   except for a few places such as the common term "value of lost load" which refers to non-served demand (#397).
190 | - `New_Build = -1` in `Generators_data.csv`: instead, use `New_Build = 0` and `Can_Retire = 0`.
191 | - The matrix-style input of the grid for Network.csv is deprecated in favor a column-style input.
192 |   Instead of columns z1, z2, ... with entries -1, 0, 1, use two columns: Start_Zone, End_Zone (#591).
193 |

233 |   for all cases (#426).
234 | 
235 | ### Removed
236 | 
237 | - The settings key `OperationsWrapping`. Its functionality has now been folded into the
238 |   `TimeDomainReduction` setting. Using the key now will print a gentle warning (#426).

  5 |  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
  6 |  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  7 |  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  8 | 
  9 |                             Preamble
 10 | 
 11 |   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 12 | freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 13 | License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 14 | software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 15 | General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 16 | Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 17 | using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 18 | the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 19 | your programs, too.
 20 | 
 21 |   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 22 | price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 23 | have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 24 | this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 25 | if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 26 | in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 27 | 
 28 |   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 29 | anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 30 | These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 31 | distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 32 | 
 33 |   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 34 | gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 35 | you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 36 | source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 37 | rights.
 38 | 
 39 |   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 40 | (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 41 | distribute and/or modify the software.
 42 | 
 43 |   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 44 | that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 45 | software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 46 | want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 47 | that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 48 | authors' reputations.
 49 | 
 50 |   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 51 | patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 52 | program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 53 | program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 54 | patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 55 | 
 56 |   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 57 | modification follow.
 58 | 
 59 |                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 60 |    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 61 | 
 62 |   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 63 | a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 64 | under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 65 | refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 66 | means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 67 | that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 68 | either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 69 | language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 70 | the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 71 | 
 72 | Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 73 | covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 74 | running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 75 | is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 76 | Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 77 | Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 78 | 
 79 |   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 80 | source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 81 | conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 82 | copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 83 | notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 84 | and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 85 | along with the Program.
 86 | 
 87 | You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 88 | you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 89 | 
 90 |   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 91 | of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 92 | distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 93 | above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 94 | 
 95 |     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 96 |     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 97 | 
 98 |     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 99 |     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
100 |     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
101 |     parties under the terms of this License.
102 | 
103 |     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
104 |     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
105 |     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
106 |     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
107 |     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
108 |     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
109 |     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
110 |     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
111 |     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
112 |     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
113 | 
114 | These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
115 | identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
116 | and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
117 | themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
118 | sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
119 | distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
120 | on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
121 | this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
122 | entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
123 | 
124 | Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
125 | your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
126 | exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
127 | collective works based on the Program.
128 | 
129 | In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
130 | with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
131 | a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
132 | the scope of this License.
133 | 
134 |   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
135 | under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
136 | Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
137 | 
138 |     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
139 |     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
140 |     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
141 | 
142 |     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
143 |     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
144 |     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
145 |     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
146 |     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
147 |     customarily used for software interchange; or,
148 | 
149 |     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
150 |     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
151 |     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
152 |     received the program in object code or executable form with such
153 |     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
154 | 
155 | The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
156 | making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
157 | code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
158 | associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
159 | control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
160 | special exception, the source code distributed need not include
161 | anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
162 | form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
163 | operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
164 | itself accompanies the executable.
165 | 
166 | If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
167 | access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
168 | access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
169 | distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
170 | compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
171 | 
172 |   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
173 | except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
174 | otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
175 | void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
176 | However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
177 | this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
178 | parties remain in full compliance.
179 | 
180 |   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
181 | signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
182 | distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
183 | prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
184 | modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
185 | Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
186 | all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
187 | the Program or works based on it.
188 | 
189 |   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
190 | Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
191 | original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
192 | these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
193 | restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
194 | You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
195 | this License.
196 | 
197 |   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
198 | infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
199 | conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
200 | otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
201 | excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
202 | distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
203 | License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
204 | may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
205 | license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
206 | all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
207 | the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
208 | refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
209 | 
210 | If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
211 | any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
212 | apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
213 | circumstances.
214 | 
215 | It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
216 | patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
217 | such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
218 | integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
219 | implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
220 | generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
221 | through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
222 | system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
223 | to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
224 | impose that choice.
225 | 
226 | This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
227 | be a consequence of the rest of this License.
228 | 
229 |   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
230 | certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
231 | original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
232 | may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
233 | those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
234 | countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
235 | the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
236 | 
237 |   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
238 | of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
239 | be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
240 | address new problems or concerns.
241 | 
242 | Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
243 | specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
244 | later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
245 | either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
246 | Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
247 | this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
248 | Foundation.
249 | 
250 |   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
251 | programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
252 | to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
253 | Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
254 | make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
255 | of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
256 | of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
257 | 
258 |                             NO WARRANTY
259 | 
260 |   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
261 | FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
262 | OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
263 | PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
264 | OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
265 | MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
266 | TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
267 | PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
268 | REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
269 | 
270 |   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
271 | WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
272 | REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
273 | INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
274 | OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
275 | TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
276 | YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
277 | PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
278 | POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
279 | 
280 |                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 9 | ## Overview
10 | GenX is a highly-configurable, [open source](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/main/LICENSE) electricity resource capacity expansion model 
11 | that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape. 
12 | 
13 | The model was [originally developed](https://energy.mit.edu/publication/enhanced-decision-support-changing-electricity-landscape/) by 
14 | [Jesse D. Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/jenkins) and 
15 | [Nestor A. Sepulveda](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/nestor-sepulveda/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by 
16 | [a team of contributors](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX#genx-team) at the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins), MIT (led by [Ruaridh MacDonald](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/ruaridh-macdonald/)), NYU (led by [Dharik Mallapragada](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/dharik-mallapragada)), and Binghamton University (led by [Neha Patankar](https://www.binghamton.edu/ssie/people/profile.html?id=npatankar)).
17 | 
18 | GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, 
19 | storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost,
20 | while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.
21 | 
22 | GenX features a modular and transparent code structure developed in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) + [JuMP](http://jump.dev/).
23 | The model is designed to be highly flexible and configurable for use in a variety of applications from academic research and technology evaluation to public policy and regulatory analysis and resource planning.
24 | Depending on the planning problem or question to be studied,
25 | GenX can be configured with varying levels of model resolution and scope, with regards to:
26 | (1) temporal resolution of time series data such as electricity demand and renewable energy availability;
27 | (2) power system operational detail and unit commitment constraints;
28 | and (3) geospatial resolution and transmission network representation.
29 | The model is also capable of representing a full range of conventional and novel electricity resources,
30 | including thermal generators, variable renewable resources (wind and solar), run-of-river, reservoir and pumped-storage hydroelectric generators,
31 | energy storage devices, demand-side flexibility, demand response, and several advanced technologies such as long-duration energy storage.
32 | 
33 | The 'main' branch is the current master branch of GenX. The various subdirectories are described below:
34 | 
35 | 1. `src/` Contains the core GenX model code for reading inputs, model generation, solving and writing model outputs.
36 | 
37 | 2. `example_systems/` Contains fully specified examples that users can use to test GenX and get familiar with its various features. 
38 | 
39 | 3. `docs/` Contains source files for documentation pertaining to the model.
40 | 
41 | ## Requirements
42 | 
43 | GenX (v0.4.4) runs on Julia v1.6 through v1.9, with a minimum version of the package JuMP v1.1.1. Julia v1.10 and v1.11 are also supported. However, we recently noticed a decline in performance with Julia v1.10, which is currently under investigation. Therefore, **we recommend using Julia v1.9**, particularly for very large cases.
44 | We recommend the users to either stick to a particular version of Julia to run GenX. If however, the users decide to switch between versions, it's very important to delete the old `Manifest.toml` file and do a fresh build of GenX when switching between Julia versions.
45 | 
46 | There is also an older version of GenX, which is also currently maintained and runs on Julia 1.3.x and 1.4.x series.
47 | For those users who has previously cloned GenX, and has been running it successfully so far,
48 | and therefore might be unwilling to run it on the latest version of Julia:
49 | please look into the GitHub branch, [old_version](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/old_version).
50 | It is currently setup to use one of the following open-source freely available solvers:
51 | - the default solver: [HiGHS](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl) for linear programming and MILP,
52 | - [Clp](https://github.com/jump-dev/Clp.jl) for linear programming (LP) problems,
53 | - [Cbc](https://github.com/jump-dev/Cbc.jl) for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems
54 | We also provide the option to use one of these two commercial solvers: 
55 | - [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com), or 
56 | - [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/22.1.1?topic=documentation-orientation-guide).
57 | Note that using Gurobi and CPLEX requires a valid license on the host machine.
58 | There are two ways to run GenX with either type of solver options (open-source free or, licensed commercial) as detailed in the section, `Getting Started`.
59 | 
60 | 
61 | ## Documentation
62 | 
63 | Detailed documentation for GenX can be found [here](https://genxproject.github.io/GenX.jl/dev).
64 | It includes details of each of GenX's methods, required and optional input files, and outputs.
65 | Interested users may also want to browse through [prior publications](https://energy.mit.edu/genx/#publications) that have used GenX to understand the various features of the tool.
66 | 
67 | 
68 | ## How to cite GenX

 1 | ## Using commercial solvers: Gurobi or CPLEX
 2 | 
 3 | If you want to use the commercial solvers Gurobi or CPLEX:
 4 | 
 5 | - Make sure you have a valid license and the actual solvers for either of Gurobi or CPLEX installed on your machine
 6 | - Add Gurobi or CPLEX to the Julia Project.
 7 | 
 8 | ```
 9 | $ julia --project=/home/youruser/GenX
10 | 
11 | julia> <press close-bracket ] to access the package manager>
12 | (GenX) pkg> add Gurobi
13 | -or-
14 | (GenX) pkg> add CPLEX
15 | ```
16 | ```@meta
17 | #TODO: Add instructions for adding Gurobi or CPLEX to the Julia Project with the new PR. 
18 | ```
19 | 
20 | - Edit the `Run.jl` file to use the commercial solver. For example, to use Gurobi, you can add the following lines to the `Run.jl` file:
21 | 
22 | ```julia
23 | using Gurobi
24 | using GenX
25 | 
26 | run_genx_case!(dirname(@__FILE__), Gurobi.Optimizer)
27 | ```
28 | 
29 | !!! warning "Warning"
30 |     Note that if you have not already installed the required Julia packages or you do not have a valid Gurobi license on your host machine, you will receive an error message and Run.jl will not run to completion.

  1 | # Running GenX
  2 | 
  3 | This section describes how to run GenX with the examples provided in the repository and with user-defined cases. To have a deeper understanding of how to structure the input files and the settings, please refer to the [User Guide](@ref).
  4 | 
  5 | ## Example cases
  6 | GenX repository contains several examples to get you started with GenX. These examples are located in the [example_systems](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems) folder of the repository and are designed to be easy to run and to demonstrate the main features of GenX. 
  7 | 
  8 | The available examples are:
  9 | 
 10 | - [1\_three\_zones](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/1_three_zones)
 11 | - [2\_three\_zones\_w\_electrolyzer](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/2_three_zones_w_electrolyzer)
 12 | - [3\_three\_zone\_w\_co2\_capture](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/3_three_zone_w_co2_capture)
 13 | - [4\_three\_zones\_w\_policies\_slack](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/4_three_zones_w_policies_slack)
 14 | - [5\_three\_zones\_w\_piecewise\_fuel](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/5_three_zones_w_piecewise_fuel)
 15 | - [6\_three\_zones\_w\_multistage](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/6_three_zones_w_multistage)
 16 | - [7\_three\_zones\_w\_colocated\_VRE\_storage](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/7_three_zones_w_colocated_VRE_storage)
 17 | - [IEEE\_9\_bus\_DC\_OPF](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/example_systems/IEEE_9_bus_DC_OPF)
 18 | 
 19 | !!! note "Note"
 20 |     The following instructions assume that you have already installed GenX and its dependencies. If you haven't, please follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](@ref).
 21 | 
 22 | To run an example, follow these steps:
 23 | 1. Open a terminal and run Julia with an environment containing GenX;
 24 | 2. Run the `Run.jl` file located in the example folder.
 25 | 
 26 | For example, to run the `1_three_zones` example, you can use the following commands:
 27 | ```
 28 | $ julia
 29 | julia> <press close-bracket ] to access the package manager>
 30 | (@v1.9) pkg> activate /path/to/env
 31 | julia> using GenX
 32 | julia> include("/path/to/GenX/example_systems/1_three_zones/Run.jl")
 33 | ``` 
 34 | where `/path/to/env` is the path to the environment containing GenX and `/path/to/GenX` is the path to the `GenX` repository containing the examples.
 35 | 
 36 | The `Run.jl` file will read the `.csv` input files which define the system, the resources, and the policies, will solve the model, and finally will write the results in a `results` folder located in the same directory as `Run.jl`.
 37 | 
 38 | !!! tip "Tip"
 39 |     You could also run the example from the terminal using the following command:
 40 |     ```
 41 |     $ julia --project=/path/to/env /path/to/GenX/example_systems/1_three_zones/Run.jl`
 42 |     ```
 43 |     This is equivalent to open a Julia REPL and call the `Run.jl` file using the `include` function.
 44 |     The first option is recommended if you want to run GenX multiple times with different settings because it avoids the overhead of recompiling the code every time you run it.
 45 | 
 46 | !!! note "Note"
 47 |     The default solver for GenX is [HiGHS](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl).
 48 | 
 49 | For more information on what happens when you run a GenX case, see the [Running GenX](@ref) section.
 50 | 
 51 | !!! note "Note"
 52 |     The first seven examples are based on a one-year example with hourly resolution, containing zones representing Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. The ten represented resources include natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage.
 53 | 
 54 | 
 55 | ## Running GenX with user-defined cases
 56 | To run GenX with a user-defined case, you need to create a folder `MyCase` with the following structure:
 57 | 
 58 | ```
 59 | MyCase
 60 | ├── settings/
 61 | ├── system/
 62 | ├── policies/
 63 | ├── resources/
 64 | ├── README.md
 65 | └── Run.jl
 66 | ```
 67 | 
 68 | where the `settings` folder contains the configuration files for the model and the solver, the `system` folder contains the `.csv` input files related to the system under study, the `resource` folder contains the `.csv` input files with the list of generators to include in the model, and the `policies` folder contains the `.csv` input files which define the policies to be included in the model. 
 69 | For instance, one case could have the following structure:
 70 | 
 71 | ```
 72 | MyCase
 73 | │ 
 74 | ├── settings
 75 | │   ├── genx_settings.yml           # GenX settings
 76 | │   ├── [solver_name]_settings.yml  # Solver settings
 77 | │   ├── multi_stage_settings.yml    # Multi-stage settings
 78 | │   └── time_domain_reduction.yml   # Time-domain clustering settings
 79 | │ 
 80 | ├── system
 81 | │   ├── Demand_data.csv
 82 | │   ├── Fuel_data.csv
 83 | │   ├── Generators_variability.csv
 84 | │   └── Network.csv
 85 | │ 
 86 | ├── policies
 87 | │   ├── CO2_cap.csv
 88 | │   ├── Minimum_capacity_requirement.csv
 89 | │   └── Energy_share_requirement.csv
 90 | │ 
 91 | ├── resources
 92 | │   ├── Thermal.csv
 93 | │   ├── Storage.csv
 94 | │   ├── Vre.csv
 95 | │   ├── Hydro.csv
 96 | │   └── policy_assignments
 97 | |       ├── Resource_minimum_capacity_requirement.csv
 98 | │       └── Resource_energy_share_requirement.csv
 99 | │
100 | └── Run.jl
101 | ```
102 | 
103 | In this example, `MyCase` will define a case with `Themal`, `Storage`, `Vre`, and `Hydro` resources, the `system` folder will provide the data for the demand, fuel, generators' variability, and network, the `policies` folder will include a CO2 cap, a minimum capacity requirement, and an energy share requirement, and the `settings` folder will contain the configuration files for the model. 
104 | 
105 | The `Run.jl` file should contain the following code:
106 | ```julia
107 | using GenX
108 | 
109 | run_genx_case!(dirname(@__FILE__))
110 | ```
111 | which will run the case using the default solver. To use a different solver, you can pass the Optimizer object as an argument to `run_genx_case!` function. For example, to use Gurobi as the solver, you can use the following code:
112 | 
113 | ```julia
114 | using GenX
115 | using Gurobi
116 | 
117 | run_genx_case!(dirname(@__FILE__), Gurobi.Optimizer)
118 | ```
119 | 
120 | To run the case, open a terminal and run the following command:
121 | ```
122 | $ julia --project="/path/to/env"
123 | julia> include("/path/to/MyCase/Run.jl")
124 | ```
125 | where `/path/to/env` is the path to the environment with `GenX` installed, and `/path/to/MyCase` is the path to the folder of the `MyCase` case.
126 | Alternatively, you can run the case directly from the terminal using the following command:
127 | ```
128 | $ julia --project="/path/to/env" /path/to/MyCase/Run.jl
129 | ```
130 | 
131 | ## What happens when you run a case
132 | *Added in 0.3.4*
133 | 
134 | The entry point for running a GenX case is the `run_genx_case!("path/to/case")` function, where `path/to/case` is the path to the case directory that contains the `.csv` files with the inputs for GenX and the `settings` folder with the configuration files.
135 | 
136 | The following are the main steps performed in this function:
137 | 
138 | 1. Establish path to environment setup files and GenX source files.
139 | 2. Read in model settings `genx_settings.yml` from the example directory.
140 | 3. Configure solver settings.
141 | 4. Load the model inputs from the example directory and perform time-domain clustering if required.
142 | 5. Generate a GenX model instance.
143 | 6. Solve the model.
144 | 7. Write the output files to a specified directory.
145 | 
146 | After the script runs to completion, results will be written to a folder called `results`, located in the current working directory.
147 | 
148 | ## Precompile GenX
149 | *Added in 0.4.1*
150 | 
151 | !!! note "Note"
152 |     By default, GenX is precompiled when the package is installed to reduce the latency of the first execution of a case. This process may take a couple of minutes, but it will reduce the time needed to run subsequent cases.
153 | 
154 | However, if you want to disable precompilation, you can set the environment variable `GENX_PRECOMPILE` to `"false"` before loading GenX:
155 | 
156 | ```
157 | $ julia --project="/path/to/env"
158 | julia> ENV["GENX_PRECOMPILE"] = "false"
159 | julia> using GenX
160 | ```
161 | 
162 | Here, `/path/to/env` is the path to the environment where GenX is installed.
163 | 
164 | !!! note "Note"
165 |     The environment variable `GENX_PRECOMPILE` must be set before loading GenX for the first time. However, to force recompilation of GenX, you can delete the `~/.julia/compiled/vZ.Y/GenX/*.ji` binaries (where vZ.Y is the version of Julia being used, e.g., v1.9), set the environment variable `GENX_PRECOMPILE` to the desired value, and then reload the package. If GenX was imported via `Pkg.develop` or `] dev`, modifying any of the package files will also force recompilation.

 1 | # GenX Model Introduction
 2 | 
 3 | ## Introduction
 4 | 
 5 | GenX allows for the simultaneous co-optimization of several interlinked power system decision layers, described below:
 6 | 
 7 | 1. Capacity expansion planning (e.g., investment and retirement decisions for a full range of centralized and distributed generation, storage, and demand-side resources)
 8 | 2. Hourly dispatch of generation, storage, and demand-side resources,
 9 | 3. Unit commitment decisions and operational constraints for thermal generators,
10 | 4. Commitment of generation, storage, and demand-side capacity to meet system operating reserves requirements,
11 | 5. Commitment of generation, storage, and demand-side capacity to meet capacity reserve requirements,
12 | 6. Transmission network power flows (including losses) and network expansion decisions, and
13 | 7. Several optional policy constraints
14 | 
15 | Depending on the dimensionality of the problem, it may not be possible to model all decision layers at the highest possible resolution of detail, so the GenX model is designed to be highly configurable, allowing the user to specify the level of detail or abstraction along each of these layers or to omit one or more layers from consideration entirely.
16 | 
17 | For example, while investment and dispatch decisions (Layers 1 and 2) are a consistent feature of the model under all configurations, the user has several options with regards to representing the operational constraints on various thermal power plants (e.g., coal, gas, nuclear, and biomass generators). Unit commitment (e.g., start-up and shut-down) decisions [Morales-España et al., 2013](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6672560) (Layer 3) can be modeled at the individual power plant level (as per [De Sisternes Jimenez, 2014](https://globalchange.mit.edu/publication/15977)); by using an efficient clustering of similar or identical units (as per [Palmintier, 2011](https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/impact-of-unit-commitment-constraints-on-generation-expansion-pla), [Palmintier, 2013](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/79147), [Palmintier, 2014](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6684593)); by using a linear relaxation (or convex hull) of the integer unit commitment constraints set; or ignoring unit commitment decisions entirely and treating generator output as fully continuous. Furthermore, different levels of resolution can be selected for each individual resource type, as desired (e.g., larger thermal units can be represented with integer unit commitment decisions while smaller units can be treated as fully continuous). In such a manner, the model can be configured to represent operating constraints on thermal generators at a level of resolution that achieves a desired balance between abstraction error and computational tractability and provides sufficient accuracy to generate insights for the problem at hand.

19 | The model can also be configured to consider commitment of capacity to supply frequency regulation (symmetric up and down) and operating reserves (up) needed by system operators to robustly resolve short-term uncertainty in demand and renewable energy forecasts and power plant or transmission network failures (Layer 4). Alternatively, reserve commitments can be ignored if desired.
20 | 
21 | Additionally, the model can approximate resource adequacy requirements through capacity reserve margin requirements at the zonal and/or system level (Layer 5). In this way, the model can approximate varying structure of capacity markets seen in deregulated electricity markets in the U.S. and other regions.
22 | 
23 | The model also allows for transmission networks to be represented at several levels of detail (Layer 6) including at a zonal level with transport constraints on power flows between zones (as per [Mai et al., 2013](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56723.pdf), [Johnston et al., 2013](http://rael.berkeley.edu/old_drupal/sites/default/files/SWITCH-WECC_Documentation_October_2013.pdf), [Hirth, 2017](https://neon.energy/emma-documentation.pdf)); or as a single zone problem where transmission constraints and flows are ignored. (A DC optimal power flow formulation is in development.) In cases where a nodal or zonal transmission model is employed, network capacity expansion decisions can be modeled or ignored, and transmission losses can be represented either as a linear function of power flows or a piecewise linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows between nodes or zones (as per [Zhang et al., 2013](https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-gtd.2012.0666), [Fitiwi et al., 2016](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/energy/v101y2016icp343-358.html)), with the number of segments in the piecewise approximation specified by the user as desired. In a multi-zonal or nodal configuration, GenX can therefore consider siting generators in different locations, including balancing tradeoffs between access to different renewable resource quality, siting restrictions, and impacts on network congestions, power flows and losses.
24 | 
25 | GenX also allows the user to specify several optional public policy constraints, such as CO2 emissions limits, minimum energy share requirements (such as renewable portfolio standard or clean energy standard policies), and minimum technology capacity requirements (e.g. technology deployment mandates).
26 | 
27 | Finally, the model is usually configured to consider a full year of operating decisions at an hourly resolution, but as this is often not tractable when considering large-scale problems with high resolution in other dimensions, GenX is also designed to model a number of subperiods -- typically multiday periods of chronologically sequential hourly operating decisions -- that can be selected via appropriate statistical clustering methods to represent a full year of operations ([De Sisternes Jimenez and Webster, 2013](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/102959), [De Sisternes Jimenez, 2014](https://globalchange.mit.edu/publication/15977), [Poncelet et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261915013276#:~:text=However%2C%20increasing%20the%20level%20of,in%20an%20increased%20computational%20cost.&text=To%20do%20so%2C%20the%20impact,renewable%20energy%20sources%20(IRES).), [Nahmmacher et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544216308556), [Blanford et al., 2016](https://ideas.repec.org/a/aen/journl/ej39-3-blanfor.html), [Merrick, 2016](https://www.osti.gov/pages/biblio/1324468), [Mallapragada et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544218315238)). GenX ships with a [built-in time-domain reduction package](https://genxproject.github.io/GenX/docs/build/time_domain_reduction.html) that uses k-means or k-medoids to cluster raw time series data for demand (load) profiles and resource capacity factor profiles into representative periods during the input processing stage of the model. This method can also consider extreme points in the time series to capture noteworthy periods or periods with notably poor fits.
28 | 
29 | With appropriate configuration of the model, GenX thus allows the user to tractably consider several interlinking decision layers in a single, monolithic optimization problem that would otherwise have been necessary to solve in different separated stages or models. The following figure reflects the range of configurations currently possible along the three key dimensions of chronological detail, operational detail, and network detail.

33 | *Figure. Range of configurations currently implemented in GenX along three key dimensions of model resolution*
34 | 
35 | The model can be configured to consider a single future planning year or multiple planning stages (or investment periods) in sequence. 
36 | 
37 | - In **single-stage planning** mode, the model formulation is static, in the sense that its objective is not to determine when investments should take place over time, but rather to produce a snapshot of the minimum-cost generation capacity mix to meet demand at least cost under some pre-specified future conditions. 
38 | - The user can formulate and solve a deterministic **multi-stage planning problem with perfect foresight** i.e. demand, cost, and policy assumptions about all stages are known and exploited to determine the least-cost investment trajectory for the entire period. The solution of this multi-stage problem relies on exploiting the decomposable nature of the multi-stage problem via the implementation of the dual dynamic programming algorithm, described in [Lara et al. 2018 here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718304466). 
39 | - The user can formulate a **sequential, myopic multi-stage planning problem**, where the model solves a sequence of single-stage investment planning problems wherein investment decisions in each stage are individually optimized to meet demand given assumptions for the current planning stage and with investment decisions from previous stages treated as inputs for the current stage. We refer to this as "myopic" (or shortsighted) mode since the solution does not account for information about future stages in determining investments for a given stage. This version is generally more computationally efficient than the deterministic multi-stage expansion with perfect foresight mode.
40 | More information on the two sequential, multi-stage planning modes can be found in the section on `Multi-stage` under the `Model function reference` tab. 
41 | 
42 | ## Uses
43 | 
44 | From a centralized planning perspective, the GenX model can help to determine the investments needed to supply future electricity demand at minimum cost, as is common in least-cost utility planning or integrated resource planning processes. In the context of liberalized markets, the model can be used by regulators and policy makers for indicative energy planning or policy analysis in order to establish a long-term vision of efficient market and policy outcomes. The model can also be used for techno-economic assessment of emerging electricity generation, storage, and demand-side resources and to enumerate the effect of parametric uncertainty (e.g., technology costs, fuel costs, demand, policy decisions) on the system-wide value or role of different resources.

84 | 
85 | In summary, the objective function can be understood as the minimization of costs associated with five sets of different decisions:
86 | 1. where and how to invest on capacity,
87 | 2. how to dispatch or operate that capacity,
88 | 3. which consumer demand segments to serve or curtail,
89 | 4. how to cycle and commit thermal units subject to unit commitment decisions,
90 | 5. and where and how to invest in additional transmission network capacity to increase power transfer capacity between zones.
91 | 
92 | Note however that each of these components are considered jointly and the optimization is performed over the whole problem at once as a monolithic co-optimization problem.
93 | 
94 | While the objective function is formulated as a cost minimization problem, it is also equivalent to a social welfare maximization problem, with the bulk of demand treated as inelastic and always served, and the utility of consumption for price-elastic consumers represented as a segment-wise approximation, as per the cost of unserved demand summation above.
95 | 
96 | # Objective Scaling
97 | Sometimes the model will be built into an ill form if some objective terms are quite large or small. To alleviate this problem, we could add a scaling factor to scale the objective function during solving while leaving all other expressions untouched. The default ```ObjScale``` is set to 1 which has no effect on objective. If you want to scale the objective, you can set the ```ObjScale``` to an appropriate value in the ```genx_settings.yml```. The objective function will be multiplied by the ```ObjScale``` value during the solving process.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | # Power Balance
 2 | 
 3 | The power balance constraint of the model ensures that electricity demand is met at every time step in each zone.
 4 | As shown in the constraint, electricity demand, $D_{t,z}$, at each time step and for each zone must be strictly equal to the sum of generation, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$, from thermal technologies ($\mathcal{H}$), curtailable variable renewable energy resources ($\mathcal{VRE}$), must-run resources ($\mathcal{MR}$), and hydro resources ($\mathcal{W}$).
 5 | At the same time, energy storage devices ($\mathcal{O}$) can discharge energy, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$ to help satisfy demand, while when these devices are charging, $\Pi_{y,z,t}$, they increase demand.
 6 | Similarly, co-located variable renewable energy and storage resources ($\mathcal{VS}$ and $\mathcal{VS}^{stor}$ to represent co-located resources with a storage component) can generate electricity from the solar PV and/or wind component and discharge electricity from the storage resource, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$ to help satisfy demand, and charge from the grid, $\Pi_{y,z,t}$, if the storage component of the resource exists.
 7 | (For the case of flexible demand resources ($\mathcal{DF}$), delaying demand, $\Pi_{y,z,t}$, decreases demand while satisfying delayed demand, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$, increases demand.)
 8 | Price-responsive demand curtailment, $\Lambda_{s,z,t}$, also reduces demand.
 9 | Finally, power flows, $\Phi_{l,t}$, on each line $l$ into or out of a zone (defined by the network map $\varphi^{map}_{l,z}$), are considered in the demand balance equation for each zone.
10 | By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign in the below constraint.
11 | At the same time losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone.
12 | The losses function $\beta_{l,t}(\cdot)$ will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see [Transmission](https://genxproject.github.io/GenX/docs/build/transmission.html)).

 1 | # Multi-stage investment planning
 2 | _Added in 0.3_
 3 | 
 4 | GenX can be used to study the long-term evolution of the power system across multiple investment stages, in the following two ways:
 5 | 
 6 | * The user can formulate and solve a deterministic **multi-stage planning problem with perfect foresight** i.e. demand, cost, and policy assumptions about all stages are known and exploited to determine the least-cost investment trajectory for the entire period.
 7 |   The solution of this multi-stage problem relies on exploiting the decomposable nature of the multi-stage problem via the implementation of the dual dynamic programming algorithm, described in [Lara et al. 2018 here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718304466). This algorithm splits up a multi-stage investment planning problem into multiple, single-period sub-problems. Each period is solved iteratively as a separate linear program sub-problem (“forward pass”), and information from future periods is shared with past periods (“backwards pass”) so that investment decisions made in subsequent iterations reflect the contributions of present-day investments to future costs. The decomposition algorithm adapts previous nested Benders methods by handling integer and continuous state variables, although at the expense of losing its finite convergence property due to potential duality gap.
 8 | * The user can formulate a **sequential, myopic multi-stage planning problem**, where the model solves a sequence of single-stage investment planning problems wherein investment decisions in each stage are individually optimized to meet demand given assumptions for the current planning stage and with investment decisions from previous stages treated as inputs for the current stage.
 9 |   We refer to this as "myopic" (or shortsighted) mode since the solution does not account for information about future stages in determining investments for a given stage.
10 |   This version is generally more computationally efficient than the deterministic multi-stage expansion with perfect foresight mode.
11 | 
12 | More information on this feature can be found in the section [Multi-stage setup](@ref).

  1 | # Fusion
  2 | _Added in v0.4.2_
  3 | 
  4 | Fusion power plants could be a future source of clean, firm electricity.
  5 | Most proposals for fusion plants use a thermal cycle, where the energy of fusion heats a working fluid.
  6 | The working fluid passes through a turbine connected to a generator.
  7 | These plants would be broadly similar to fission plants.
  8 | They might also have some fusion-specific operational behaviors, which are implemented in this module.
  9 | 
 10 | This fusion module is implemented **only** for thermal plants with unit commitment (THERM=1).
 11 | 
 12 | (Some proposals for fusion plants, notably those by Helion Energy, would not need a thermal cycle and are not well-described by this module.)
 13 | 
 14 | ## Description of the fusion model
 15 | 
 16 | There are three domains in which a fusion plant of this model may differ from a standard thermal plant.
 17 | 
 18 | 1. **Parasitic power**. Fusion plants may require significant parasitic ("recirculating") power for various subsystems, or to initiate and drive the reactions.
 19 | 2. **Hourly-scale pulsed operational behavior**. Pulsed _tokamak_ plants may need to operate in cycles lasting one to a few hours.
 20 | 3. **Maintenance and associated constraints.** Maintenance may be more significant for fusion than other plants, and materials-engineering-related limitations may constrain plant operation.
 21 | 
 22 | There are nine optional parameters for fusion in this model; all can be mixed and matched.
 23 | Some of the properties span more than one of these domains.
 24 | 
 25 | ### Parasitic power
 26 | Fusion plant designs often require significant amounts of electrical energy (and instantenous power)
 27 | 
 28 | 1. to maintain the vacuum pumps, cryogenic systems, tritium plants,
 29 | 2. for heating systems, control magnet systems, target manufacturing, or lasers, 
 30 | 3. or for starting up a fusion plasma pulse.
 31 | 
 32 | These correspond to what we term
 33 | 1. Passive parasitic power: systems which are always on regardless of whether the plant is in the committed state (actively producing electricity). These parasitic loads may be reduced during extended scheduled maintenance periods.
 34 | 2. Active parasitic power: systems which are required while the plant is producing electricity. In magnetic fusion devices the amount of power required for these systems is likely nearly independent of the power level of the plant. Therefore in this model the active parasitic power depends on the commitment state of the plant, not the power level.
 35 | 3. Pulse start power and pulse start energy. Magnetic fusion devices may require a large amount of power to start the plasma pulse. This can be up to hundreds of MW, but only for a few seconds to minutes. GenX is an hourly electricity systems model, so this behavior cannot be resolved in detail. Instead, the peak power draw from the grid and the time-integral of the power draw (pulse start energy) are input parameters.
 36 | The pulse start _power_ is used as part of the capacity reserve margin formulation, and the pulse start _energy_ is used elsewhere.
 37 | (In practical designs this power draw would largely be buffered on-site, so the external grid would not see a sudden spike.)
 38 | 
 39 | ### Hourly-scale pulsed operational behavior
 40 | 
 41 | Pulsed tokamaks (as opposed to steady-state tokamaks) often call for an operational cycle where the plasma is on for 30 minutes to a few hours before carefully being drawn down.
 42 | The _maximum pulse length_ is typically limited by the engineering of the "central solenoid", one of the large magnets.
 43 | A _dwell time_ of a few minutes to 30 minutes is taken to allow various systems to be reset and readied for the next plasma pulse; during this time there is no plasma and no fusion occuring.
 44 | Restarting the plasma may require a significant amount of parasitic power draw, described above.
 45 | 
 46 | #### Pulses are stressful
 47 | Starting a plasma pulse stresses the central solenoid (for pulsed tokamaks), magnets more generally (in other designs), first wall components, and other systems.
 48 | Concerns of cyclic thermal fatigue may limit the number of pulse starts.
 49 | 
 50 | This module implements a limit expressed in maximum starts per year.
 51 | 
 52 | ### Maintenance and maintenance-driven operational constraints
 53 | 
 54 | Maintenance is likely more lengthy (and therefore more economically significant) for fusion than for existing types of power plants.
 55 | This fusion module is fully compatible with the scheduled maintenance module.
 56 | There also also three fusion-specific aspects. 
 57 | 1. The reduction of passive parasitic power during scheduled maintenance (mentioned above), 
 58 | 2. the constraint on the maximum pulse starts per year (mentioned above).
 59 | 3. In many designs, neutrons damage the first wall, blanket, and/or vacuum vessel of the plant and they eventually need to be replaced. This can be expressed as a limit on the total (gross) energy produced by the plant between maintenance cycles. This module implements a constraint that can limit the total energy production (as measured in full-power-years) over a year.
 60 | 
 61 | ## How to use
 62 | A fusion plant is a type of Thermal resource.
 63 | In addition to the standard Thermal columns (cost, up time, down time, ramp rates, min power) there is one required `fusion` column and nine optional columns in `Thermal.csv` file:
 64 | 
 65 | 1. `fusion` should be `1` for fusion plants and `0` otherwise.
 66 | 2. `parasitic_passive`.
 67 | 3. `parasitic_active`.
 68 | 4. `parasitic_start_energy`.
 69 | 5. `parasitic_start_power`.
 70 | 6. `dwell_time`.
 71 | 7. `max_up_time`.
 72 | 8. `max_starts`.
 73 | 9. `max_fpy_per_year`.
 74 | 10. `parasitic_passive_maintenance_remaining`.
 75 | 
 76 | The purpose, defaults, units, and valid ranges for these parameters are described below.
 77 | 
 78 | #### Parasitic power parameters
 79 | The parameters `parasitic_passive`, `parasitic_active`, `parasitic_start_energy`, and `parasitic_start_power` must have values of zero or more.
 80 | These values are expressed as fractions of the plant's gross capacity.
 81 | For example, if `vCAP` is 1000 MW and `parasitic_passive` is 0.1, the plant would require a 100 MW parasitic power draw.
 82 | The maximum gross output of the plant is 1000 MW, and the maximum net output is 900 MW.
 83 | By default these four parasitic load parameters are $0$.
 84 | 
 85 | The `parasitic_start_energy` and `parasitic_start_power` are related, as described above.
 86 | If starting a plasma pulse in a 1000-MW-gross plant requires a draw of 500 MW for 3 minutes, then `parasitic_start_power` would be $0.5$ and `parasitic_start_energy` would be $(500/1000) * (3/60) = 0.025$, where 60 is the number of minutes in an hour. 
 87 | The plasma startup sequence is assumed to be shorter than an hour: while this is not checked programatically, the `parasitic_start_power` should, logically, always be equal to or larger than the `parasitic_start_energy`.
 88 | 
 89 | #### Dwell time
 90 | The `dwell_time` parameter is expressed in fractions of an hour.
 91 | It must be between $0$ and $1$.
 92 | The default is $0$.
 93 | 
 94 | The dwell time is counted in the same hour as the start of a plasma pulse.
 95 | Therefore the pulse start hour may have less net generation due to the `parasitic_start_energy` as well as the dwell time.
 96 | 
 97 | _Nota bene_: while at first blush the dwell time and `parastic_start_energy` might seem interchangeable as ways to reduce the net power output during the start hour, a dwell time does not contribute to the accumulated gross power generation as is constrained by `max_fpy_per_year`.
 98 | 
 99 | #### Operational constraints
100 | The `max_up_time` constraint is activated by entering an integer denoting the length of the pulse in hours.
101 | The value must logically be positive and less than the number of hours in the simulation.
102 | A `max_up_time` of `1` will result in a new pulse starting every hour.
103 | A `max_up_time` of `0` is not well defined; the default of no restriction is entered with `-1`.
104 | 
105 | _Note_: if the `dwell_time` is nonzero, the actual pulse length always will be shorter than the `max_pulse_length` here.
106 | 
107 | The `max_starts` constraint is activated by entering a positive integer denoting the maximum number of starts per year.
108 | A `max_starts` of `0` would prevent the plant from starting; the default of no restriction is entered with `-1`.
109 | 
110 | The `max_fpy_per_year` constraint is activated by entering a fraction between $0$ and $1$.
111 | This constrains the total gross power production as a fraction of the gross capacity measured in full-power years (FPY).
112 | The default of no restriction is entered with `-1`.
113 | Note that if the plant has a dwell time $t_\mathrm{dw} > 0$ and a maximum up time, the theoretical maximum gross power production is already less than one full-power year per year.
114 | For example, if there is a 0.5 hour dwell time and a max up time of 2 hours, then the plant can operate at peak power for 1.5 hours out of every 2, which yields a theoretical maximum throughput of 0.75 FPY per year.
115 | In this case a `max_fpy_per_year` of 0.75 or more would have no effect.
116 | 
117 | #### Modification to parasitic power during maintenance
118 | 
119 | The `parasitic_passive_maintenance_remaining` parameter is only used for plants also using the scheduled maintenance module (`maint = 1`).
120 | The value must be between $0$ and $1$.
121 | The default is $0$; in this case there is no parasitic power during scheduled maintenance periods.
122 | With a value of $1$ the parasitic power does not decrease during maintenance.
123 | With a value of $0.5$ it is reduced by half, and so on.
124 | 
125 | ## Outputs produced
126 | 
127 | Use of the fusion module leads to two new outputs files, and changes to existing output files.
128 | 
129 | - `fusion_pulse_starts`. This file is similar to `start/commit/shutdown.csv` for unit committment.
130 | There is a column for each fusion resource component and a row for each timestep.
131 | Values are number of plant units (of a given resource component) starting a fusion pulse in each timestep.
132 | 
133 | - `fusion_parasitic_power`. This file is similar to `charge.csv`.
134 | There is a column for each fusion resource component and a row for each timestep.
135 | Values are the parasitic energy in MWh drawn by each resource component in each timestep.
136 | This is the sum of the passive parasitic power, the active parasitic power, and the pulse start energy.
137 | Values are always nonnegative. Positive values represent power flowing from the grid to the plant.
138 | 
139 | - `fusion_net_capacity_factor`. This is the ratio of the net power production (gross - parasitic) to the annual net capacity of the plant. The numerator here is always smaller than that of the standard capacity factor and could even be negative if the parasitic power is very large and the plant is not used often. The denominator is also smaller than that in the standard capacity factor because it accounts for parasitic power and dwell time.
140 | 
141 | ### Notes on other outputs
142 | 
143 | - `capacity_factor`: This standard output file reports the _gross_ capacity factor for the plant:
144 | The ratio of the gross power produced to (the gross capacity * one year). Compare with the `fusion_net_capacity_factor` above.
145 | 
146 | - `charge`: fusion parasitic power is reported in this file.
147 | 
148 | ## Mathematical formulation of fusion module
149 | 
150 | ### Pulse start and pulse status
151 | There are two new variables, representing the number of pulse starts ($\chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t}$) and pulses underway ($\nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t}$).
152 | These are similar to the conventional unit commitment start $\chi$ and commit status $\nu$.
153 | 
154 | ```math
155 | \begin{align*}
156 | 0 & \le \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \le \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \Delta^\mathrm{total}_{y,z} \\
157 | 0 & \le \nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \le  \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \Delta^\mathrm{total}_{y,z}
158 | \end{align*}
159 | ```
160 | 
161 | The two pulse variables are linked using $\tau^{pulse,up}_{y,z}$, the `max_up_time`:
162 | 
163 | ```math
164 | \nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \le  \sum_{\hat{t} = t - (\tau^{pulse,up}_{y,z} -1)}^{t} \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,\hat{t}}
165 | ```
166 | 
167 | They are further constrained by the plant's _conventional_ commitment state,
168 | 
169 | ```math
170 | \begin{align*}
171 | \nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t} & \le \nu_{y,z,t} \\
172 | \quad \quad \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t} & \le \nu_{y,z,t}.
173 | \end{align*}
174 | ```
175 | 
176 | The optional constraint on the maximum number of pulses per year, `max_starts` $\overline{\chi}^{pulse}_{y,z}$ is formulated as
177 | 
178 | ```math
179 | \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \cdot \omega_t \cdot \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z} \le \overline{\chi}^{pulse}_{y,z} \cdot \Delta^{\mathrm{total}}_{y,z}.
180 | ```
181 | 
182 | ### Dwell time limit on power
183 | During the hours when the plant starts, the power generation $\Theta_{y,z,t}$ is limited due to the `dwell_time` $\tau^{dwell}_{y,z}$ by the constraint
184 | 
185 | ```math
186 | \Theta_{y,z,t} \le \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \left(\nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t} - \tau^{dwell}_{y,z} \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t}\right).
187 | ```
188 | 
189 | ### Max FPY per year constraint
190 | Optionally, the gross power generation during the year is limited by the maximum-FPY-per-year parameter $\overline{\Theta}^{FPY}_{y,z}$
191 | 
192 | ```math
193 | \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \Theta_{y,z,t} \le T \cdot \Delta^{\mathrm{total}}_{y,z} \cdot \overline{\Theta}^{FPY}_{y,z}
194 | ```
195 | 
196 | where $T$ is the number of hours in the year.
197 | 
198 | ### Parasitic power
199 | 
200 | The passive parasitic power is 
201 | 
202 | ```math
203 | \Pi^{parasitic,pass}_{y,z,t} = f^{parasitic,pass}_{y,z} \cdot \left(\Delta^{total}_{y,z} - \chi^{maint}_{y,z,t} \left(1 - f^{parasitic,pass,maint}_{y,z}\right) \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z}\right)
204 | ```
205 | 
206 | where $\chi^{maint}_{y,z,t}$ is the number of units under maintenance and $f^{parasitic,pass,maint}_{y,z}$ is fraction of passive parasitic power which remains during maintenance.
207 | 
208 | The active parasitic power is
209 | 
210 | ```math
211 | \Pi^{parasitic,act}_{y,z,t} = \left(\nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t} - \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \cdot \tau^{dwell}_{y,z}\right) \cdot f^{parasitic,act}_{y,z} \cdot \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z}
212 | ```
213 | 
214 | and the parasitic pulse start energy is 
215 | 
216 | ```math
217 | \Pi^{parasitic,pulse,energy}_{y,z,t} = \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \cdot f^{parasitic,pulse,energy}_{y,z} \cdot \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z}.
218 | ```
219 | 
220 | The **total parasitic power** from each technology $y$ in zone $z$ is
221 | 
222 | ```math
223 | \Pi^{parasitic,total}_{y,z,t} = \Pi^{parasitic,pass}_{y,z,t} + \Pi^{parasitic,act}_{y,z,t} + \Pi^{parasitic,pulse,energy}_{y,z,t};
224 | ```
225 | 
226 | the sum of the parasitic power across all fusion technologies $y$ in zone $z$ is subtracted from the power balance in that zone.
227 | 
228 | The parasitic pulse start power, used for the capacity reserve margin formulation, is
229 | 
230 | ```math
231 | \Pi^{parasitic,pulse,power}_{y,z,t} = \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \cdot f^{parasitic,pulse,power}_{y,z} \cdot \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z}.
232 | ```
233 | 
234 | ### Capacity reserve margin contribution
235 | 
236 | The capacity 
237 | 
238 | As a reminder, for standard thermal plants the capacity reserve margin contribution is $\epsilon^{CRM}_{y,z,p} \cdot \Delta^{total}$.
239 | 
240 | For fusion plants, the contribution depends on $\nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t}$ rather than $\Delta^{\mathrm{total}}_{y,z}$.
241 | 
242 | ```math
243 | 
244 | \epsilon^{CRM}_{y,z,p} \left(\nu^{pulse}_{y,z,t}
245 | - \chi^{pulse}_{y,z,t} \cdot \tau^{dwell}_{y,z}
246 | \right) \overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z}
247 | 
248 | - \epsilon^{CRM}_{y,z,p} \left(\Pi^{parasitic,act}_{y,z,t} + \Pi^{parasitic,pulse,power}_{y,z,t}\right) - \Pi^{parasitic, pass}_{y,z,t}
249 | 
250 | ```
251 | 
252 | The first term is gross power production possible during an hour, depending on the pulse state.
253 | The second term subtracts the parasitic active and start power. 
254 | The last term subtracts the passive parasitic power.
255 | Unlike the first two it is not subject to the reliability derating $\epsilon^{CRM}$ because passive power is assumed to be drawn even during unscheduled downtime.
256 | 
257 | Note that in this formulation, it is possible for CRM contribution to be negative (particularly, not not necessarily, if the plant is a net sink of electricity).
258 | 
259 | This formulation is cross-compatible with the maintenance module. If a plant is undergoing maintenance the first two terms will be zero, and the parasitic passive power will be reduced (see formula above).
260 | 
261 | ### Energy share requirement
262 | 
263 | The total parasitic power is subtracted from a plant's contribution to an energy share requirement.
264 | Thus for fusion the plant contributes its _net_ energy production.
265 | 
266 | # Developer's docs
267 | 
268 | The Fusion module was written so that its constraints of the module could be "bolted on" to anything with 
269 | 
270 | - a power-like expression (e.g. `vP[y,:]` or `vP[y,:] + vREG[y,:] + vRSV[y,:]`), 
271 | - a capacity-like expression (`eTotalCap`) and 
272 | - a commitment-state expression (`vCOMMIT`).
273 | 
274 | So far it has only been attached to thermal plants with unit commitment, but it could be used in the future for more complicated entities like a heat source attached to a thermal storage unit and a generator.
275 | Like the `maintenance` module, the constraints of the fusion module apply to one "resource component" at a time, rather than a `"SET"` of resources.
276 | The time-series variables and expressions for each fusion component have unique `base_name`s, like `vFusionPulseStart_MA_fusion[t=1:T]` for a resource named `MA_fusion`.
277 | This makes writing output slightly trickier, as the variables and expressions are evaluated (with `JuMP.value`) one at a time.
278 | 
279 | Many of the functions below assume little about what they are attached to.
280 | Others act as the interface between fusion and a plant built with the `thermal_commit` module.

  1 | # Optimized Scheduled Maintenance
  2 | _Added in v0.4_
  3 | 
  4 | In the real world, some types of resources (notably, fission) require regular scheduled maintenance, which often takes several weeks.
  5 | During this time, the plant produces no power.
  6 | This module allows GenX to find the best time of year for plants to undergo maintenance.
  7 | 
  8 | Scheduled maintenance is implemented **only** for thermal plants with unit commitment (THERM=1).
  9 | 
 10 | ## Description of the maintenance model
 11 | A plant requires a single contiguous period of $h \ge 1$ hours of maintenance, every $y \ge 1$ years.
 12 | For each plant, the best time to start the maintenance period is determined by the optimizer.
 13 | 
 14 | During maintenance, the plant cannot be "commited", and therefore
 15 | 
 16 | * uses no fuel,
 17 | * produces no power,
 18 | * and does not contribute to reserves.
 19 | 
 20 | Additionally, 
 21 | 
 22 | * the plant does not contribute to any Capacity Reserve Margin.
 23 | 
 24 | ### Treatment of plants that require maintenance only every few years
 25 | GenX models a long-term equilibrium,
 26 | and each problem generally represents a single full year.
 27 | If a plant requires maintenance every $y$ years, we take the simplification that at least $1/y$ of the plants must undergo maintenance in the modeled year.
 28 | 
 29 | See also "Interaction with integer unit commitment" below.
 30 | 
 31 | ### Reduction of number of possible start dates
 32 | This module creates constraints which work across long periods, and consequently can be very expensive to solve.
 33 | In order to reduce the expense, the set of possible maintenance start dates can be limited.
 34 | Rather than have maintenance potentially start every hour, one can have possible start dates which are once per day, once per week, etc.
 35 | (In reality, maintenance is likely scheduled months in advance, so optimizing down to the hour may not be realistic anyway.)
 36 | 
 37 | ## How to use
 38 | There are four columns which need to be added to the plant data, i.e. in the resource `.csv` files:
 39 | 
 40 | 1. `MAINT` should be `1` for plants that require maintenance and `0` otherwise.
 41 | 2. `Maintenance_Duration` is the number of hours the maintenance period lasts.
 42 | 3. `Maintenance_Cycle_Length_Years`. If `1`, maintenance every year, if `3` maintenance every 3 years, etc.
 43 | 4. `Maintenance_Begin_Cadence`. Spacing between hours in which maintenance can start.
 44 | 
 45 | The last three fields must be integers which are greater than 0. 
 46 | They are ignored for any plants which do not require maintenance.
 47 | 
 48 | `Maintenance_Duration` must be less than the total number of hours in the year.
 49 | 
 50 | If `Maintenance_Begin_Cadence` is `1` then the maintenance can begin in any hour.
 51 | If it is `168` then it can begin in hours 1, 169, 337, etc.
 52 | 
 53 | ## Restrictions on use
 54 | The maintenance module has these restrictions:
 55 | 
 56 | - More than a single maintenance period per year (i.e. every three months) is not possible in the current formulation.
 57 | - Only full-year cases can be run; there must be only one "representative period".
 58 | It would not make sense to model a *month*-long maintenance period when the year is modeled as a series of representative *weeks*, for example.
 59 | 
 60 | ### Interaction with integer unit commitment
 61 | If integer unit commitment is on (`UCommit=1`) this module may not produce correct results; there may be more maintenance than the user wants.
 62 | This is because the formulation specifies that the number of plants that go down for maintenance in the simulated year must be at least (the number of plants in the zone)/(the maintenance cycle length in years).
 63 | As a reminder, the number of plants is `eTotalCap / Cap_Size`.
 64 | 
 65 | If there were three 500 MW plants (total 1500 MW) in a zone, and they require maintenance every three years (`Maintenance_Cycle_Length_Years=3`), 
 66 | the formulation will work properly: one of the three plants will go under maintenance.
 67 | 
 68 | But if there was only one 500 MW plant, and it requires maintenance every 3 years, the constraint will still make it do maintenance **every year**, because `ceil(1/3)` is `1`. The whole 500 MW plant will do maintenance. This is the unexpected behavior.
 69 | 
 70 | However, if integer unit commitment was relaxed to "linearized" unit commitment (`UCommit=2`), the model will have only 500 MW / 3 = 166.6 MW worth of this plant do maintenance.
 71 | 
 72 | ## Hint: pre-scheduling maintenance
 73 | If you want to pre-schedule when maintenance occurs, you might not need this module.
 74 | Instead, you could set the maximum power output of the plant to zero for a certain period, or make its fuel extremely expensive during that time.
 75 | However, the plant would still be able to contribute to the Capacity Reserve Margin.
 76 | 
 77 | ## Outputs produced
 78 | If at least one plant has `MAINT=1`, a file `maint_down.csv` will be written listing how many plants are down for maintenance in each timestep.
 79 | 
 80 | ## Notes on mathematical formulation
 81 | The formulation of the maintenance state is very similar to the formulation of unit commitment.
 82 | 
 83 | There is a variable called something like `vMSHUT` which is analogous to `vSTART` and controls the start of the maintenance period.
 84 | There is another variable called something like `vMDOWN` analogous to `vCOMMIT` which controls the maintenance status in any hour.
 85 | 
 86 | A constraint ensures that the value of `vMDOWN` in any hour is always more than the number of `vMSHUT`s in the previous `Maintenance_Duration` hours.
 87 | 
 88 | Another constraint ensures that the number of plants committed (`vCOMMIT`) at any one time plus the number of plants under maintenance (`vMDOWN`) is less than the total number of plants.
 89 | 
 90 | ## Developer note: adding maintenance to a resource
 91 | The maintenance formulation is applied on a per-resource basis, by calling the function [`GenX.maintenance_formulation!`](@ref). 
 92 | See [`GenX.maintenance_formulation_thermal_commit!`](@ref) for an example of how to apply it to a new resource.
 93 | 
 94 | * The resource must have a `eTotalCap`-like quantity and a `cap_size`-like parameter; only the ratio of the two is used.
 95 | * The resource must have a `vCOMMIT`-like variable which is proportional to the maximum power output, etc at any given timestep.

  1 | # Tutorial 1: Configuring Settings
  2 | 
  3 | [Interactive Notebook of the tutorial](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX-Tutorials/blob/main/Tutorials/Tutorial_1_Configuring_Settings.ipynb)
  4 | 
  5 | GenX is easy to customize to fit a variety of problems. In this tutorial, we show which settings are available to change, what their defaults are, and how to change them in your code.
  6 | 
  7 | ## What settings are there?
  8 | 
  9 | There are 21 settings available to edit in GenX, found in the file `genx_settings.yml`. These settings are described at the [Model settings parameters
 10 | ](@ref) page of the documentation. The file is located in the `settings` folder in the working directory. To change the location of the file, edit the `settings_path` variable in `Run.jl` within your directory.
 11 | 
 12 | Most settings are set as either 0 or 1, which correspond to whether or not to include a specific feature. For example, to use `TimeDomainReduction`, you would set its parameter to 1 within `genx_settings.yml`. If you would like to run GenX without it, you would set its parameter to 0.
 13 | 
 14 | Other settings, such as `CO2Cap`, have more options corresponding to integers, while some settings such as `ModelingtoGenerateAlternativeSlack` take a numerical input directly (in this case, the slack value). Two settings, `Solver` and `TimeDomainReductionFolder` take in text as input. To learn more about different solvers, read [here](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX.jl/blob/main/docs/src/User_Guide/solver_configuration.md). For `TimeDomainReductionFolder`, specify the name of the directory you wish to see the results in. For a more comprehensive description of the input options, see the documentation linked above.
 15 | 
 16 | To see how changing the settings affects the outputs, see Tutorials 3 and 7.
 17 | 
 18 | Below is the settings file for `example_systems/1_three_zones`:
 19 | 
 20 | ![png](./files/genxsettings.png)
 21 | 
 22 | All `genx_settings.yml` files in `example_systems` specify most parameters. When configuring your own settings, however, it is not necessary to input all parameters as defaults are specified for each one in `configure_settings.jl`.
 23 | 
 24 | ![png](./files/default_settings.png)
 25 | 
 26 | To open `genx_settings.yml` in Jupyter, use the function `YAML.load(open(...))` and navigate to file in the desired directory:
 27 | 
 28 | 
 29 | ```julia
 30 | using YAML
 31 | genx_settings_SNE = YAML.load(open("example_systems/1_three_zones/settings/genx_settings.yml"))
 32 | ```
 33 | 
 34 | ```
 35 |     Dict{Any, Any} with 19 entries:
 36 |       "NetworkExpansion"                        => 1
 37 |       "ModelingToGenerateAlternativeIterations" => 3
 38 |       "ParameterScale"                          => 1
 39 |       "EnergyShareRequirement"                  => 0
 40 |       "PrintModel"                              => 0
 41 |       "TimeDomainReduction"                     => 1
 42 |       "Trans_Loss_Segments"                     => 1
 43 |       "CapacityReserveMargin"                   => 0
 44 |       "ModelingtoGenerateAlternativeSlack"      => 0.1
 45 |       "MethodofMorris"                          => 0
 46 |       "StorageLosses"                           => 1
 47 |       "MultiStage"                              => 0
 48 |       "OverwriteResults"                        => 0
 49 |       "UCommit"                                 => 2
 50 |       "ModelingToGenerateAlternatives"          => 0
 51 |       "MaxCapReq"                               => 0
 52 |       "MinCapReq"                               => 1
 53 |       "CO2Cap"                                  => 2
 54 |       "WriteShadowPrices"                       => 1
 55 | ```
 56 | 
 57 | 
 58 | Since all settings have defaults, you only need to specify the settings you would like to change. In fact, you can leave your settings file completely blank and it will still run! Let's try editing `genx_settings` in `example_systems/1_three_zones` to contain no parameters:
 59 | 
 60 | 
 61 | ```julia
 62 | new_params = Dict() # Empty dictionary
 63 | YAML.write_file("example_systems/1_three_zones/settings/genx_settings.yml", new_params)
 64 | ```
 65 | 
 66 | The empty file will look like this:
 67 | 
 68 | ![png](./files/genx_settings_none.png)
 69 | 
 70 | Now, we run GenX and output the file `capacity.csv` from the `results` folder. To do this, we use the function `include`, which takes a .jl file and runs it in jupyter notebook:
 71 | 
 72 | 
 73 | ```julia
 74 | include("example_systems/1_three_zones/Run.jl")
 75 | ```
 76 | 
 77 | ```

335 | As you can see, this runs without a problem! To try with your own parameters, edit the `new_params` dictionary with whatever parameters you'd like to try and run the cells again.Note: to output the results, you'll have to either delete the previous `results` folder, or input the name of the new results folder (e.g. `results_1`) when calling `CSV.read` as above.
336 | 
337 | 
338 | Finally, let's rewite `genx_settings.yml` to put the original settings in the example back: 
339 |

 4 | 
 5 | To run GenX, there are five mandatory input files: `Fuels_data.csv`, `Network.csv`, `Demand_data.csv`, `Generators_variability.csv`, and `Generators_data.csv` (note that `Network.csv` is not mandatory if running a single-zone model). Detailed descriptions of these files can be found in the [GenX Inputs](@ref) page of the documentation.
 6 | This tutorial helps visualize the file `Network.csv` using the example system `example_systems/1_three_zones`.
 7 | 
 8 | 
 9 | ```julia
10 | using CSV
11 | using DataFrames
12 | ```
13 | 
14 | The input file `Network.csv` contains the nodes of your network, how they connect to each other, and some important features about them. Below is the network file for `example_systems/1_three_zones`:

26 | MA, CT, and ME are the abbreviations for states Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. However, since the US region of New England contains other states as well, MA in this case is also used to refer to those states.
27 | 
28 | Columns `Start_Zone` and `End_Zone` specify the network of the three regions. In this case, there are only two network lines, specified in the `Network_Lines` columns. The `Start_Zone` column indicates that the first node, MA, is the source of both lines as both rows have value 1. Rows `z1` and `z2` have values of 2 and 3 in `End_Zone`, which  means both nodes CT and ME recieve energy from node MA. This is also indicated in the column `transmission path name'.

  4 | 
  5 | To run GenX, we use the file `Run.jl`. This file will solve the optimization problem and generate the output files as described in the documentation and previous tutorial. It does so by first generating the model, then solving the model, both according to settings described in `genx_settings.yml`. However, `Run.jl` only contains one commmand, `run_genx_case!(dirname(@__FILE__))`. This can be confusing for users viewing the files for the first time. In reality, this function signals many more functions to run, generating and solving the model. This tutorial explains how the model in GenX is generated. The next tutorial will then describe how it is solved.
  6 | 
  7 | We'll start by explaining JuMP, the optimization package that GenX uses to generate and solve the model.

 18 | JuMP is a modeling language for Julia. It allows users to create models for optimization problems, define variables and constraints, and apply a variety of solvers for the model. 
 19 | 
 20 | GenX is a __Linear Program (LP)__, which is a form of optimization problem in which a linear objective is minimized (or maximized) according to a set of linear constraints. For more information on LPs, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming).
 21 | 
 22 | 
 23 | ```julia
 24 | using JuMP
 25 | using HiGHS
 26 | ```
 27 | 
 28 | Let's say we want to build a power grid consisting of and coal and wind plants. We want to decrease the cost of producing energy while still meeting a certain emissions threshold and full grid demand. Coal plants are cheaper to build and run but have higher emissions than wind farms. To find the minimum cost of a power grid meeting these constraints, we construct an LP using JuMP.
 29 | 
 30 | ```math
 31 | \begin{aligned}
 32 | & \min 10 x + 15 y &\text{Objective function (cost)}\\ 
 33 | & \text{s.t.} & \\
 34 | & x + y \geq 10 &\text{Grid Demand}\\
 35 | & 55x + 70y \leq \ 1000 &\text{Construction constraint}\\
 36 | & 40 x + 5 y \leq 200 &\text{Emissions constraint} \\
 37 | & x, y \geq 0 &\text{Non-negativity constraints}\\
 38 | \end{aligned}
 39 | ```
 40 | 
 41 | The core of the JuMP model is the function `Model()`, which creates the structure of our LP. `Model()` takes an optimizer as its input.
 42 | 
 43 | 
 44 | ```julia
 45 | power = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)
 46 | ```
 47 | 
 48 |     A JuMP Model
 49 |     Feasibility problem with:
 50 |     Variables: 0
 51 |     Model mode: AUTOMATIC
 52 |     CachingOptimizer state: EMPTY_OPTIMIZER
 53 |     Solver name: HiGHS
 54 | 
 55 | The model needs variables, defined using the JuMP function `@variable`:
 56 | 
 57 | 
 58 | ```julia
 59 | @variable(power,x) # Coal
 60 | @variable(power,y) # Wind
 61 | ```
 62 | 
 63 | 
 64 | Using the JuMP function `@constraint`, we can add the constraints of the model:
 65 | 
 66 | 
 67 | ```julia
 68 | @constraint(power, non_neg_x, x >= 0) # Non-negativity constraint (can't have negative power plants!)
 69 | @constraint(power, non_neg_y, y >= 0) # Non-negativity constraint
 70 | 
 71 | @constraint(power, emissions, 40x + 5y <= 200) # Emisisons constraint
 72 | @constraint(power, construction_costs, 55x + 70y <= 1000) # Cost of constructing a new plant
 73 | 
 74 | @constraint(power, demand, x + y >= 10) # Grid demand
 75 | ```
 76 | 
 77 | `` x + y \geq 10 ``
 78 | 
 79 | Next, the function `@expression` defines an expression that can be used in either a constraint or objective function. In GenX, expressions are defined throughout the model generation and put into constraints and the objective function later.
 80 | 
 81 | 
 82 | ```julia
 83 | @expression(power,objective,10x+15y)
 84 | ```
 85 | $ 10 x + 15 y $
 86 | 
 87 | Finally, we define the objective function itself:
 88 | 
 89 | 
 90 | ```julia
 91 | @objective(power, Min, objective)
 92 | ```
 93 | 
 94 | `` 10 x + 15 y ``
 95 | 
 96 | Our model is now set up! 
 97 | 
 98 | 
 99 | ```julia
100 | print(power)
101 | ```
102 | 
103 | ```math
104 | \begin{aligned}
105 | \min\quad & 10 x + 15 y\\
106 | \text{Subject to} \quad & x \geq 0\\
107 |  & y \geq 0\\
108 |  & x + y \geq 10\\
109 |  & 40 x + 5 y \leq 200\\
110 |  & 55 x + 70 y \leq 1000\\
111 | \end{aligned} 
112 | ```
113 | 
114 | 
115 | In the next Tutorial, we go over how to use JuMP to solve the model we've constructed.
116 | 
117 | When `Run.jl` is called, the model for GenX is constructed in a similar way, but with many more factors to consider. The next section goes over how the GenX model is constructed before it is solved.
118 | 
119 | ### Generate Model 
120 | 
121 | The basic structure of the way `Run.jl` generates and solves the model is as follows:
122 | 
123 | ![png](./files/LatexHierarchy.png)
124 | 
125 | The function `run_genx_case(case)` takes the "case" as its input. The case is all of the input files and settings found in the same folder as `Run.jl`. For example, in `example_systems/1_three_zones`, the case is:
126 | 
127 | ```julia
128 | cd(readdir,"example_systems/1_three_zones")
129 | ```
130 |

145 | 
146 | 
147 | `Run_genx_case` defines the __setup__, which are the settings in `genx_settings.yml`. From there, either `run_genx_case_simple(case, mysetup)` or`run_genx_case_multistage(case, mysetup)` is called. Both of these define the __inputs__ and __optimizer__. The optimizer is the solver as specified in `genx_settings.yml`, and the inputs are a variety of parameters specified by the settings and csv files found in the folder. Both of these functions then call `generate_model(mysetup, myinputs, OPTIMIZER)`, which is the main subject of this tutorial.
148 | 
149 | As in the above example, `generate_model` utilizes the JuMP functions `Model()`, `@expression`, `@variable`, and `@constraints` to form a model. This section goes through `generate_model` and explains how the expressions are formed to create the model.
150 | 
151 | #### Arguments 
152 | 
153 | `Generate_model` takes three arguments: setup, inputs, and optimizer:
154 | 
155 | To generate the arguments, we have to set a case path (this is set automatically when `Run.jl` is called):
156 | 
157 | 
158 | ```julia
159 | using GenX
160 | ```
161 | 
162 | 
163 | ```julia
164 | case = joinpath("example_systems/1_three_zones") 
165 | ```
166 | 
167 | ```
168 |     "example_systems/1_three_zones"
169 | ```
170 | 
171 | Setup includes the settings from `genx_settings.yml` along with the default settings found in `configure_settings.jl`. The function `configure_settings` combines the two.
172 | 
173 | ```julia
174 | genx_settings = GenX.get_settings_path(case, "genx_settings.yml") # Settings YAML file path
175 | writeoutput_settings = GenX.get_settings_path(case, "output_settings.yml") # Set output path
176 | setup = GenX.configure_settings(genx_settings,writeoutput_settings) # Combines genx_settings with defaults
177 | ```
178 | ```

205 | ```
206 | It's here that we create the folder `TDR_results` before generating the model. This occurs if TimeDomainReduction is set to 1 in the setup. As a reminder, `TDR_results` is __not__ overwritten when called again. The cell below will delete a preexisting `TDR_results` folder if it is there.
207 | 
208 | 
209 | ```julia
210 | TDRpath = joinpath(case, setup["TimeDomainReductionFolder"])
211 | system_path = joinpath(case, setup["SystemFolder"])
212 |

214 |

226 |     end
227 | end
228 | ```

255 | ```
256 | 
257 | 
258 | The optimizer argument is taken from setup:
259 | 
260 | 
261 | ```julia
262 | OPTIMIZER =  GenX.configure_solver(settings_path,HiGHS.Optimizer)
263 | ```
264 | 
265 | The function `configure_solver` converts the string from "Solver" to a [MathOptInterface](https://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/stable) optimizer so it can be used in the JuMP model as the optimizer. It also goes into the settings file for the specified solver (in this case HiGHS, so `1_three_zones/settings/highs_settings.yml`) and uses the settings to configure the solver to be used later.
266 | 
267 | 
268 | ```julia
269 | typeof(OPTIMIZER)
270 | ```
271 | ```
272 |     MathOptInterface.OptimizerWithAttributes
273 | ```
274 | 
275 | The "inputs" argument is generated by the function `load_inputs` from the case in `run_genx_case_simple` (or multistage). If TDR is set to 1 in the settings file, then `load_inputs` will draw some of the files from the `TDR_results` folder. `TDR_results` is produced when the case is run. 
276 | 
277 | 
278 | ```julia
279 | inputs = GenX.load_inputs(setup, case)

324 | 
325 | Now that we have our arguments, we're ready to generate the model itself.
326 | 
327 | #### Run generate_model
328 | 
329 | This subsection replicates the arguments in the function `generate_model`. __Note:__ Running some of these cells for a second time will throw an error as the code will attempt to define a new expression with the name of an existing expression. To run the Tutorial again, clear and restart the kernel.
330 | 
331 |  First, we initialize a model and define the time step and zone variables
332 | 
333 | 
334 | ```julia
335 | EP = Model(OPTIMIZER)  # From JuMP
336 | ```
337 | 
338 |     A JuMP Model
339 |     Feasibility problem with:
340 |     Variables: 0
341 |     Model mode: AUTOMATIC
342 |     CachingOptimizer state: EMPTY_OPTIMIZER
343 |     Solver name: HiGHS
344 | 
345 | ```julia
346 | T = inputs["T"];   # Number of time steps (hours)
347 | Z = inputs["Z"];   # Number of zones
348 | ```
349 | 
350 | Next, the dummy variable vZERO, the objective function, the power balance expression, and zone generation expression are all initialized to zero:
351 | 
352 | 
353 | ```julia
354 | # Introduce dummy variable fixed to zero to ensure that expressions like eTotalCap,
355 | # eTotalCapCharge, eTotalCapEnergy and eAvail_Trans_Cap all have a JuMP variable
356 | 
357 | GenX.set_string_names_on_creation(EP, Bool(setup["EnableJuMPStringNames"]))
358 | @variable(EP, vZERO == 0);
359 | 
360 | # Initialize Power Balance Expression
361 | # Expression for "baseline" power balance constraint
362 | GenX.create_empty_expression!(EP, :ePowerBalance, (T, Z))
363 | 
364 | # Initialize Objective Function Expression
365 | EP[:eObj] = AffExpr(0.0)
366 | 
367 | GenX.create_empty_expression!(EP, :eGenerationByZone, (Z, T))
368 | 
369 | # Energy losses related to technologies
370 | GenX.create_empty_expression!(EP, :eELOSSByZone, Z)
371 | ```
372 | ```
373 |     1×1848 Matrix{Int64}:
374 |      0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  …  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
375 | ```
376 | Next, we go through some of the settings in setup and, if they've been set to be utilized (i.e. have a nonzero value), define expressions from their corresponding input files:
377 | 
378 | 
379 | ```julia
380 | # Initialize Capacity Reserve Margin Expression
381 | if setup["CapacityReserveMargin"] > 0
382 |     GenX.create_empty_expression!(EP, :eCapResMarBalance, (inputs["NCapacityReserveMargin"], T))
383 | end
384 | 
385 | # Energy Share Requirement
386 | if setup["EnergyShareRequirement"] >= 1
387 |     GenX.create_empty_expression!(EP, :eESR, inputs["nESR"])
388 | end
389 | 
390 | if setup["MinCapReq"] == 1
391 |     GenX.create_empty_expression!(EP, :eMinCapRes, inputs["NumberOfMinCapReqs"])
392 | end
393 | 
394 | if setup["MaxCapReq"] == 1
395 |     GenX.create_empty_expression!(EP, :eMaxCapRes, inputs["NumberOfMaxCapReqs"])
396 | end
397 | ```
398 | 
399 | 
400 | The other settings will be used later on.
401 | 
402 | Next, we define the model infrastructure using functions found in `src/core`. These take entries from inputs and setup to create more expressions in our model (EP). To see what the functions do in more detail, see the source code and [core documentation](https://genxproject.github.io/GenX/dev/core/#Discharge).
403 | 
404 | 
405 | ```julia
406 | # Infrastructure
407 | GenX.discharge!(EP, inputs, setup)
408 | 
409 | GenX.non_served_energy!(EP, inputs, setup)
410 | 
411 | GenX.investment_discharge!(EP, inputs, setup)
412 | 
413 | if setup["UCommit"] > 0
414 |     GenX.ucommit!(EP, inputs, setup)
415 | end
416 | 
417 | GenX.fuel!(EP, inputs, setup)
418 | 
419 | GenX.co2!(EP, inputs) 
420 | 
421 | if setup["OperationalReserves"] > 0
422 |     GenX.operational_reserves!(EP, inputs, setup)
423 | end
424 | 
425 | if Z > 1
426 |     GenX.investment_transmission!(EP, inputs, setup)
427 |     GenX.transmission!(EP, inputs, setup)
428 | end
429 | 
430 | if Z > 1 && setup["DC_OPF"] != 0
431 |     GenX.dcopf_transmission!(EP, inputs, setup)
432 | end
433 | ```
434 | ```
435 |     Discharge Module
436 |     Non-served Energy Module
437 |     Investment Discharge Module
438 |     Unit Commitment Module
439 |     Fuel Module
440 |     CO2 Module
441 |     Investment Transmission Module
442 |     Transmission Module
443 | ```
444 | 
445 | We then define variables and expressions based on the resources in the inputs and setup arguments. The details of these can be found in the `src/resources` folder and the "resources" folder under Model Function Reference in the documentation:
446 | 
447 | 
448 | ```julia
449 | # Technologies
450 | # Model constraints, variables, expression related to dispatchable renewable resources
451 | 
452 | if !isempty(inputs["VRE"])
453 |     GenX.curtailable_variable_renewable!(EP, inputs, setup)
454 | end
455 | 
456 | # Model constraints, variables, expression related to non-dispatchable renewable resources
457 | if !isempty(inputs["MUST_RUN"])
458 |     GenX/must_run!(EP, inputs, setup)
459 | end
460 | 
461 | # Model constraints, variables, expression related to energy storage modeling
462 | if !isempty(inputs["STOR_ALL"])
463 |     GenX.storage!(EP, inputs, setup)
464 | end
465 | 
466 | # Model constraints, variables, expression related to reservoir hydropower resources
467 | if !isempty(inputs["HYDRO_RES"])
468 |     GenX.hydro_res!(EP, inputs, setup)
469 | end
470 | 
471 | if !isempty(inputs["ELECTROLYZER"])
472 |     GenX.electrolyzer!(EP, inputs, setup)
473 | end
474 | 
475 | # Model constraints, variables, expression related to reservoir hydropower resources with long duration storage
476 | if inputs["REP_PERIOD"] > 1 && !isempty(inputs["STOR_HYDRO_LONG_DURATION"])
477 |     GenX.hydro_inter_period_linkage!(EP, inputs, setup)
478 | end
479 | 
480 | # Model constraints, variables, expression related to demand flexibility resources
481 | if !isempty(inputs["FLEX"])
482 |     GenX.flexible_demand!(EP, inputs, setup)
483 | end
484 | 
485 | # Model constraints, variables, expression related to thermal resource technologies
486 | if !isempty(inputs["THERM_ALL"])
487 |     GenX.thermal!(EP, inputs, setup)
488 | end
489 | 
490 | # Model constraints, variables, expressions related to the co-located VRE-storage resources
491 | if !isempty(inputs["VRE_STOR"])
492 |     GenX.vre_stor!(EP, inputs, setup)
493 | end
494 | 
495 | 
496 | ```
497 | 
498 | Finally, we define expressions and variables using policies outlined in the inputs. These functions can be found in `src/policies` and in the [Emission mitigation policies](@ref) section of the documentation:
499 | 
500 | 
501 | ```julia
502 | # Policies
503 | 
504 | if setup["OperationalReserves"] > 0
505 |     GenX.operational_reserves_constraints!(EP, inputs)
506 | end
507 | 
508 | # CO2 emissions limits
509 | if setup["CO2Cap"] > 0
510 |     GenX.co2_cap!(EP, inputs, setup)
511 | end
512 | 
513 | # Endogenous Retirements
514 | if setup["MultiStage"] > 0
515 |     GenX.endogenous_retirement!(EP, inputs, setup)
516 | end
517 | 
518 | # Energy Share Requirement
519 | if setup["EnergyShareRequirement"] >= 1
520 |     GenX.energy_share_requirement!(EP, inputs, setup)
521 | end
522 | 
523 | #Capacity Reserve Margin
524 | if setup["CapacityReserveMargin"] > 0
525 |     GenX.cap_reserve_margin!(EP, inputs, setup)
526 | end
527 | 
528 | if (setup["MinCapReq"] == 1)
529 |     GenX.minimum_capacity_requirement!(EP, inputs, setup)
530 | end
531 | 
532 | if setup["MaxCapReq"] == 1
533 |     GenX.maximum_capacity_requirement!(EP, inputs, setup)
534 | end
535 | 
536 | ```
537 | ```
538 |     Energy Share Requirement Policies Module
539 |     Capacity Reserve Margin Policies Module
540 |     Minimum Capacity Requirement Module

  5 | In Tutorial 4, we went over how the model is generated when GenX is run using `Run.jl`. In the function `run_genx_case_simple` (or multistage), after `generate_model` is called, `solve_model` is called to solve the EP.

 23 | & \text{s.t.} & \\
 24 | & x + y \geq 10 &\text{Grid Demand}\\
 25 | & 55x + 70y \leq \ 1000 &\text{Construction constraint}\\
 26 | & 40 x + 5 y \leq 200 &\text{Emissions constraint} \\
 27 | & x, y \geq 0 &\text{Non-negativity constraints}\\

149 | ## GenX
150 | 
151 | Let's optimize the GenX model created in the last Tutorial. To do so, we'll create the inputs for `generate_model` and run it. 
152 | 
153 | 
154 | ```julia

163 | writeoutput_settings = GenX.get_settings_path(case, "output_settings.yml")
164 | setup = GenX.configure_settings(genx_settings,writeoutput_settings)
165 | 
166 | settings_path = GenX.get_settings_path(case)
167 | 
168 | ### Create TDR_Results
169 | TDRpath = joinpath(case, setup["TimeDomainReductionFolder"])
170 | system_path = joinpath(case, setup["SystemFolder"])
171 | 
172 | if setup["TimeDomainReduction"] == 1
173 |     GenX.prevent_doubled_timedomainreduction(system_path)
174 |     if !GenX.time_domain_reduced_files_exist(TDRpath)
175 |         println("Clustering Time Series Data (Grouped)...")
176 |         GenX.cluster_inputs(case, settings_path, setup)
177 |     else
178 |         println("Time Series Data Already Clustered.")
179 |     end
180 | end
181 | 
182 | OPTIMIZER =  GenX.configure_solver(settings_path,HiGHS.Optimizer);
183 | 
184 | inputs = GenX.load_inputs(setup, case)
185 | ```
186 |

240 | 
241 | ## Infeasibility 
242 | 
243 | In some cases, your model may not be able to return a value. This happens when no value can be found that satisfies all constraints. To see this, let's go back to our simple example and change one of the parameters to break the model.
244 | 
245 | ```math
246 | \begin{aligned}
247 | & \min 10 x + 15 y &\text{Objective function (cost)}\\ 
248 | & \text{s.t.} & \\
249 | & x + y \geq 10 &\text{Grid Demand}\\
250 | & 55x + 70y \leq \ 1000 &\text{Construction constraint}\\
251 | & 40 x + 5 y \leq 200 &\text{Emissions constraint} \\
252 | & 7 x + 30 y \geq 500 &\textbf{New Constraint} \\
253 | & x, y \geq 0 &\text{Non-negativity constraints}\\
254 | \end{aligned}
255 | ```
256 | 
257 | ```julia
258 | @constraint(power, new, 7x + 30y >= 500)
259 | 
260 | ```
261 | 
262 | ```math
263 | 7 x + 30 y \geq 500 
264 | ```
265 | 
266 | ```julia
267 | print(power)
268 | ```
269 | 
270 | ```math
271 | \begin{aligned}
272 | \min\quad & 10 x + 15 y\\
273 | \text{Subject to} \quad & x \geq 0\\
274 |  & y \geq 0\\
275 |  & x + y \geq 10\\
276 |  & 7 x + 30 y \geq 500\\
277 |  & 40 x + 5 y \leq 200\\
278 |  & 55 x + 70 y \leq 1000\\
279 |  & x \in \mathbb{Z}\\
280 |  & y \in \mathbb{Z}\\
281 | \end{aligned} 
282 | ```
283 | 
284 | ```julia
285 | optimize!(power)
286 | ```
287 | 
288 | ```

305 |                         0 (heuristics)
306 | ```
307 | 
308 | In this case, the infeasibility was detected on the presovle since it's clear no solution would fit within all constraints. For information on how to debug an infeasible solution, see the [JuMP documentaion](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/manual/solutions/#Conflicts). Some solvers, such as Gurobi, will compute what is causing the conflict, e.g. which constraints are infeasible with one another (HiGHS does not do this). 
309 | 
310 | GenX version 0.4 has the feature `ComputeConflict` in settings. If the model does not work, try setting `ComputeConflict = 1`, and the conflicting constraints will be returned.
311 | 
312 | Tutorial 6 describes the solver settings, how to change them, and the effects of PreSolve, Crossover, and Feasibility Tolerance.

 55 | end

 59 | 
 60 | ### The HiGHS Solver
 61 | 
 62 | In the example files, the solver is [HiGHS](https://highs.dev). HiGHS is freely available for all to use. Other solvers, such as [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com), are available for free for academics. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be focusing on HiGHS. 
 63 | 
 64 | To set the solver preferences, go into the settings folder of your case and select the YAML file of the solver you're using.
 65 | 
 66 | 
 67 | ```julia
 68 | settings_folder = cd(readdir,joinpath(case,"Settings")) # Print Settings folder
 69 | ```
 70 | ```
 71 |     7-element Vector{String}:
 72 |     ".DS_Store"
 73 |     "clp_settings.yml"
 74 |     "cplex_settings.yml"
 75 |     "genx_settings.yml"
 76 |     "gurobi_settings.yml"
 77 |     "highs_settings.yml"
 78 |     "time_domain_reduction_settings.yml"
 79 | ```
 80 |     
 81 | ```julia
 82 | highs_settings = YAML.load(open(joinpath(case,"Settings/highs_settings.yml")))
 83 | ```
 84 | ```
 85 |     Dict{Any, Any} with 6 entries:
 86 |       "Method"        => "choose"
 87 |       "Feasib_Tol"    => 0.1
 88 |       "run_crossover" => "on"
 89 |       "TimeLimit"     => 1.0e23
 90 |       "Optimal_Tol"   => 0.1
 91 |       "Pre_Solve"     => "choose"
 92 | ```
 93 | 
 94 | The function `configure_highs` in `src/configure_solver` contains a list of default settings for the HiGHS solver
 95 | 
 96 | ![png](./files/highs_defaults.png)
 97 | 
 98 | There are about 80, so we'll only focus on a few for now. In most cases, you can leave the other settings on default. 
 99 | 
100 | The default settings are combined with the settings you specify in `highs_settings.yml` in `configure_highs`, which is called from `configure_solver` in `run_genx_case_simple` right before the model is generated.
101 | 
102 | 
103 | ### Feasibility Tolerance
104 | 
105 | The parameters `Feasib_Tol` and `Optimal_Tol` represent the feasibility of the primal and dual functions respectively. Without going into too much detail, a [__dual function__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(optimization)) is an analagous formulation of the original ("primal") function whose objective value acts as a lower bound to the primal function. The objective value of the primal function is then the upper bound of the dual function. HiGHS will solve the dual and primal at each time step, then terminate when the solutions of the two are within a certain tolerance range. For more information on how this works specifically in HiGHS, see the [HiGHS documentaion](https://ergo-code.github.io/HiGHS/dev/terminology). 
106 | 
107 | If we decrease the tolerance parameters, the objective value becomes closer to the "true" optimal value.
108 | 
109 | 
110 | ```julia
111 | # Change tolerance, generate and solve model`
112 | tols = [1e-7,1e-4,1e-2,1e-1]
113 | OV = zeros(1,4)
114 | 
115 | for i in range(1,length(tols))
116 |     println(" ")
117 |     println("----------------------------------------------------")
118 |     println("Iteration ",i)
119 |     println("Tolerance = ",tols[i])
120 |     println("----------------------------------------------------")
121 |     highs_settings["Feasib_Tol"] = tols[i]
122 |     highs_settings["Optimal_Tol"] = tols[i]
123 |     YAML.write_file(joinpath(case,"settings/highs_settings.yml"), highs_settings)
124 |     OPTIMIZER1 = GenX.configure_solver(settings_path,HiGHS.Optimizer)
125 |     EP = GenX.generate_model(setup,inputs,OPTIMIZER1)
126 |     GenX.solve_model(EP,setup)
127 |     OV[i] = objective_value(EP)
128 | end
129 | ```
130 | Using the smallest tolerance as our base, we can see the error as the tolerance increases:
131 | 
132 | ```julia
133 | DataFrame([tols[2:end] abs.(OV[2:end] .- OV[1])],["Tolerance", "Error"])
134 | ```
135 | ```
136 | 3×2 DataFrame
137 |     Row	Tolerance	Error
138 |         Float64	    Float64
139 |     ───────────────────────────
140 |     1	0.0001	    0.0
141 |     2	0.01	    1.81899e-12
142 |     3	0.1	        3.45608e-11
143 | ```
144 | 
145 | ```julia
146 | using Plots
147 | using Plotly
148 | ```
149 | 
150 | 
151 | ```julia
152 | # Plot the error as a function of the tolerance
153 | plotlyjs()
154 | Plots.scatter(tols[2:end], abs.(OV[2:end] .- OV[1]),legend=:topleft,
155 |                 ylabel="Error", xlabel="Tolerance",size=(920,400),label=:"Error",title="Tolerance of Solver vs Error")
156 | ygrid!(:on, :dashdot, 0.1)
157 | ```

160 | 
161 | ### PreSolve
162 | 
163 | In optimization, presolve is a stage at the beginning of the solver in which the problem is simplified to remove redunant constraints and otherwise simplify the problem before the optimization itself begins. The default for presolve in GenX is "choose", allowing the solver to use presolve only if it will reduce computation time. 
164 | 
165 | Let's try setting presolve to off and on, then compare computation times.
166 | 
167 | 
168 | ```julia
169 | # First, set tolerances back to original
170 | highs_settings["Feasib_Tol"] = 1e-5
171 | highs_settings["Optimal_Tol"] = 1e-5
172 | YAML.write_file(joinpath(case,"Settings/highs_settings.yml"), highs_settings)    
173 | ```
174 | 
175 | ```julia
176 | highs_settings["Pre_Solve"] = "off"
177 | YAML.write_file(joinpath(case,"Settings/highs_settings.yml"), highs_settings)
178 | OPTIMIZER2 = GenX.configure_solver(setup["Solver"], settings_path);
179 | EP2 = GenX.generate_model(setup,inputs,OPTIMIZER2)

298 | As we can see, the runtime with PreSolve is shorter, and would be even shorter for a larger system. However, it could introduce numerical inaccuracies. If you find the model is struggling to converge, try turn PreSolve off.
299 | 
300 | ```julia
301 | # Write PreSolve back to choose
302 | highs_settings["Pre_Solve"] = "choose"
303 | YAML.write_file(joinpath(case,"Settings/highs_settings.yml"), highs_settings)

305 | 
306 | ### Crossover
307 | 
308 | Crossover is a method in which, at each step of the optimization algorithm, the solution is pushed to the boundary of the solution space. This allows for a potentially more accurate solution, but can be computationally intensive. Let's try turning crossover on and off and see what solutions we get:
309 | 
310 | 
311 | ```julia
312 | highs_settings["run_crossover"] = "off"
313 | YAML.write_file(joinpath(case,"Settings/highs_settings.yml"), highs_settings)
314 | OPTIMIZER4 = GenX.configure_solver(setup["Solver"], settings_path);

 1 | # Time-domain reduction
 2 | 
 3 | Modeling grid operations for each hour of the year can be computationally expensive for models with many zones and resources. Rather than modeling and optimizing power grid operations at a high temporal resolution (e.g., hourly, over a full year) while evaluating new capacity investments, which can be computationally expensive for large-scale studies with several resources, it may be useful to consider a reduced temporal resolution to model annual grid operations. Time-domain reduction is often employed in capacity expansion models as a way to balance model spatial and temporal resolution as well as representation of dispatch, while ensuring reasonable computational times. Such a time-domain reduction is often employed in capacity expansion models as a way to balance model spatial and temporal resolution as well as representation of dispatch, while ensuring reasonable computational times. GenX allows the option of performing time-domain reduction on the user supplied time-series input data to produce a representative time series at the desired level of temporal resolution. The time-domain reduction method provided allows the user to automate these features while specifying the various parameters of the time-domain reduction 'clustering' algorithm to be used in formulating the resulting optimization model. The below table summarizes the list of parameters to be specified by the user to perform the time domain reduction implemented in GenX. These parameters are passed to GenX via the YAML file `time_domain_reduction_settings.yml`.
 4 | 
 5 | It's also possible for GenX perform clustering separately from the optimization task. Check out the [Running a case with Time Domain Reduction](@ref) section for more information. 
 6 | 
 7 | **Structure of the time\_domain\_reduction.yml file**
 8 | 
 9 | |**Key** | **Description**|
10 | | :------------ | :-----------|
11 | |Timesteps\_per\_period | The number of timesteps (e.g., hours) in each representative period (i.e. 168 for weeks, 24 for days, 72 for three-day periods, etc).|
12 | |UseExtremePeriods | 1 = Include outliers (by performance or demand/resource extreme) as their own representative extreme periods. This setting automatically includes periods based on criteria outlined in the dictionary `ExtremePeriods`. Extreme periods can be selected based on following criteria applied to demand profiles or solar and wind capacity factors profiles, at either the zonal or system level. A) absolute (timestep with min/max value) statistic (minimum, maximum) and B) integral (period with min/max summed value) statistic (minimum, maximum). For example, the user could want the hour with the most demand across the whole system to be included among the extreme periods. They would select Demand, System, Absolute, and Max.|
13 | ||0 = Do not include extreme periods.|
14 | |ExtremePeriods | If **UseExtremePeriods = 1**, use this dictionary to select which types of extreme periods to use. Select by profile type (Demand, PV, or Wind), geography (Zone or System), grouping by timestep or by period (Absolute or Integral), and statistic (Maximum or Minimum).|
15 | |ClusterMethod |Either `kmeans` or `kmedoids`, the method used to cluster periods and determine each time step's representative period.|
16 | |ScalingMethod |Either `N` or `S`, the decision to normalize ([0,1]) or standardize (mean 0, variance 1) the input data prior to clustering.|
17 | |MinPeriods |The minimum number of representative periods used to represent the input data. If using UseExtremePeriods, this must be greater or equal to the number of selected extreme periods. If `IterativelyAddPeriods` is off, this will be the total number of representative periods.|
18 | |MaxPeriods| The maximum number of representative periods - both clustered and extreme - that may be used to represent the input data.|
19 | |IterativelyAddPeriods |1 = Add representative periods until the error threshold between input data and represented data is met or the maximum number of representative periods is reached.|
20 | ||0 = Use only the minimum number of representative periods. This minimum value includes the selected extreme periods if `UseExtremePeriods` is on.|
21 | |Threshold |Iterative period addition will end if the period farthest from its representative period (as measured using Euclidean distance) is within this percentage of the total possible error (for normalization) or 95% of the total possible error (± 2 σ for standardization). E.g., for a threshold of 0.01, each period must be within 1% of the spread of possible error before the clustering iterations will terminate (or until the maximum is reached).|
22 | |IterateMethod | Either ‘cluster' (Default) or ‘extreme', whether to increment the number of clusters to the kmeans/kmedoids method or to set aside the worst-fitting periods as a new extreme periods.|
23 | |nReps |Default = 200, the number of kmeans/kmedoids repetitions at the same setting.|
24 | |DemandWeight| Default = 1, a multiplier on demand columns to optionally prioritize better fits for demand profiles over resource capacity factor or fuel price profiles.|
25 | |WeightTotal |Default = 8760, the sum to which the relative weights of representative periods will be scaled.|
26 | |ClusterFuelPrices| Either 1 or 0, whether or not to use the fuel price time series in `Fuels_data.csv` in the clustering process. If 'no', this function will still write `Fuels_data.csv` in the TimeDomainReductionFolder with reshaped fuel prices based on the number and size of the representative periods but will not use the fuel price time series for selection of representative periods.|

 1 | ## Running Modeling to Generate Alternatives with GenX
 2 | 
 3 | GenX includes a modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) package that can be used to automatically enumerate a diverse set of near cost-optimal solutions to electricity system planning problems. To use the MGA algorithm, user will need to perform the following tasks:
 4 | 
 5 | 1. Add a `Resource_Type` column in all the resource `.csv` files denoting the type of each technology.
 6 | 2. Add a `MGA` column in all the resource `.csv` files denoting the availability of the technology.
 7 | 3. Set the `ModelingToGenerateAlternatives` flag in the `genx_settings.yml` file to 1.
 8 | 4. Set the `ModelingtoGenerateAlternativeSlack` flag in the `genx_settings.yml` file to the desirable level of slack.
 9 | 5. Set the `ModelingToGenerateAlternativesIterations` flag to half the total number of desired solutions, as each iteration provides 2 solutions.
10 | 6. Set the `MGAAnnualGeneration` flag in the `genx_settings.yml` file to the desired MGA formulation.
11 | 7. Solve the model using `Run.jl` file.
12 | 
13 | Results from the MGA algorithm would be saved in MGA\_max and MGA\_min folders in the case folder.

 1 | # Method\_of\_morris\_range.csv ([Example](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/main/Example_Systems/MethodofMorrisExample/OneZone/Method_of_morris_range.csv))
 2 | 
 3 | This file contains the settings parameters required to run the Method of Morris algorithm in GenX. 
 4 | 
 5 | !!! note "Note"
 6 |     This file is needed if the `MethodofMorris` flag is ON in the YAML file `genx_settings.yml`.
 7 | 
 8 | |**Column Name** | **Description**|
 9 | | :------------ | :-----------|
10 | |Resource | This column contains **unique** names of resources available to the model. Resources can include generators, storage, and flexible or time shiftable demand.|
11 | |Zone | Integer representing zone number where the resource is located. |
12 | |Lower\_bound | Percentage lower deviation from the nominal value|
13 | |Upper\_bound| Percentage upper deviation from the nominal value|
14 | |Parameter| Column from the `Generators_data.csv` file containing uncertain parameters|
15 | |Group| Group the uncertain parameters that will be changed all at once while performing the sensitivity analysis. For example, if the fuel price of natural gas is uncertain, all generators consuming natural gas should be in the same group. Group name is user defined|
16 | |p_steps| Number of steps between upper and lower bound|
17 | |total\_num\_trajectory| Total number of trakectories through the design matrix|
18 | |num\_trajectory| Selected number of trajectories throigh the design matrix|
19 | |len\_design\_mat| Length of the design matrix|
20 | |policy| Name of the policy|
21 | 
22 | Notes:
23 | 1. Upper and lower bounds are specified in terms of percentage deviation from the nominal value.
24 | 2. Percentage variation for uncertain parameters in a given group is identical. For example, if solar cluster 1 and solar cluster 2 both belong to the ‘solar’ group, their `Lower_bound` and `Upper_bound` must be identical.
25 | 3. `P_steps` should at least be = 1%, i.e., `Upper_bound – Lower_bound < p_steps`
26 | 4. `P_steps` for parameters in one group must be identical
27 | 5. `Total_num_trajectory` should be around 3 to 4 times the total number of uncertain parameters
28 | 6. `num_trajectory` should be approximately equal to the total number of uncertain parameters
29 | 7. `len_design_mat` should be 1.5 to 2 times the total number of uncertain parameters
30 | 8. Higher number of `num_trajectory` and `len_design_mat` would lead to higher accuracy
31 | 9. Upper and lower bounds should be specified for all the resources included in the `Generators_data.csv` file. If a parameter related to a particular resource is not uncertain, specify upper bound = lower bound = 0.

/docs/src/User_Guide/model_configuration.md:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 | # Model settings parameters
  2 | 
  3 | The first step in configuring a GenX model is to specify the model settings parameters. These parameters are specified in a `genx_settings.yml` file inside a `settings` folder which must be located in the current working directory. Settings include those related to model structure, solution strategy and outputs, policy constraints, and others. In particular:
  4 | - Model structure related settings parameters affect the formulation of the model constraints and objective function. 
  5 | - Computational performance related parameters affect the accuracy of the solution.
  6 | - Policy related parameters specify the policy type and policy goal. 
  7 | - Network related parameters specify settings related to transmission network expansion and losses.
  8 | Note that all settings parameters are case sensitive.
  9 | 
 10 | (Optional) The user can also select the output files that they want to export using the `output_settings.yml` file. This file containes a list of `yes/no` options for each output file, and should be located in the `settings` folder. By default, if `output_settings.yml` is not included, GenX will export all output files. 
 11 | 
 12 | The following tables summarize the model settings parameters and their default/possible values.

112 | ## 2 Settings-specific outputs
113 | 
114 | This section includes the output files that GenX will print if corresponding function is specified in the Settings.
115 | 
116 | ### 2.1 CapacityValue.csv
117 | 
118 | This file includes the time-dependent capacity value calculated for each generator. GenX will print this file only if the capacity reserve margin constraints are modeled through the setting file. Each row of the file (excluding the header) corresponds to a generator specified in the inputs. Each column starting from the t1 to the second last one stores the result of capacity obligation provided in each hour divided by the total capacity. Thus the number is unitless. If the capacity margin reserve is not binding for one hour, GenX will return zero. The last column specified the name of the corresponding capacity reserve constraint. Note that, if the user calculates the hour-weight-averaged capacity value for each generator using data of the binding hours, the result is what RTO/ISO call capacity credit.
119 | 
120 | <!-- #### 2.2 ExportRevenue.csv
121 | 
122 | This file includes the export revenue in $ of each zone. GenX will print this file only when a network is present and Locational Marginal Price (LMP) data is available to the GenX. The Total row includes the time-step-weighted summation of the time-dependent values shown below. For each time-step, the export revenue is calculated as the net outbound powerflow multiplied by the LMP. It is noteworthy that this export revenue is already part of the generation revenue, and the user should not double count.
123 | 
124 | 
125 | #### 2.3 Importcost.csv
126 | 
127 | This file includes the import cost in $ of each zone. GenX will print this file only when a network is present and Locational Marginal Price (LMP) data is available to the GenX. The Total row includes the time-step -weighted summation of the time-dependent values shown below. For each time step, the import cost is calculated as the net inbound powerflow multiplied by the LMP. It is noteworthy that this import cost is already part of the load payment, and the user should not double count. -->
128 | 
129 | ### 2.2 EnergyRevenue.csv
130 | 
131 | This file includes the energy revenue in $ earned by each generator through injecting into the grid. Only annual sum values are available.
132 | 
133 | ### 2.3 ChargingCost.csv
134 | 
135 | This file includes the charging cost  in $ of earned by each generator through withdrawing from the grid. Only annual sum values are available.
136 | 
137 | ### 2.4 ReserveMargin.csv
138 | 
139 | This file includes the shadow prices of the capacity reserve margin constraints. GenX will print this file only when capacity reserve margin is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver, as described earlier. Each row (except the header) corresponds to a capacity reserve margin constraint, and each column corresponds to an time step. As a reminder, GenX models the capacity reserve margin (aka capacity market) at the time-dependent level, and each constraint either stands for an overall market or a locality constraint.
140 | 
141 | ### 2.5 ReserveMarginRevenue.csv
142 | 
143 | This file includes the capacity revenue earned by each generator listed in the input file. GenX will print this file only when capacity reserve margin is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Each row corresponds to a generator, and each column starting from the 6th to the second last is the total revenue from each capacity reserve margin constraint. The revenue is calculated as the capacity contribution of each time steps multiplied by the shadow price, and then the sum is taken over all modeled time steps. The last column is the total revenue received from all capacity reserve margin constraints. As a reminder, GenX models the capacity reserve margin (aka capacity market) at the time-dependent level, and each constraint either stands for an overall market or a locality constraint.
144 | 
145 | ### 2.6 ESR\_prices.csv
146 | 
147 | This file includes the renewable/clean energy credit price of each modeled RPS/CES constraint. GenX will print this file only when RPS/CES is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. The unit is $/MWh.
148 | 
149 | ### 2.7 ESR\_Revenue.csv
150 | 
151 | This file includes the renewable/clean credit revenue earned by each generator listed in the input file. GenX will print this file only when RPS/CES is modeled and the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Each row corresponds to a generator, and each column starting from the 6th to the second last is the total revenue earned from each RPS constraint. The revenue is calculated as the total annual generation (if elgible for the corresponding constraint) multiplied by the RPS/CES price. The last column is the total revenue received from all constraint. The unit is $.
152 | 
153 | ### 2.8 SubsidyRevenue.csv
154 | 
155 | This file includes subsidy revenue earned if a generator specified Min\_Cap is provided in the input file. GenX will print this file only the shadow price can be obtained form the solver. Do not confuse this with the Minimum Capacity Carveout constraint, which is for a subset of generators, and a separate revenue term will be calculated in other files. The unit is $.

  1 | # Multi-stage setup
  2 | 
  3 | This section describes the available features, inputs and model components related to formulating and solving multi-stage investment planning problems. Two different types of multi-stage problems can be setup:
  4 | * Perfect foresight: A single multi-stage investment planning problem that simultaneously optimizes capacity and operations across all specified investment stages
  5 | * Myopic: Sequential solution of single-stage investment planning for each investment stage, where capacity additions and retirements from the previous stages are used to determine initial (or existing) capacity at the beginning of the current stage. 
  6 | 
  7 | The table below summarizes the key differences in the two model setups.

 16 | ### Additional inputs needed for multi-stage modeling
 17 | 
 18 | ####  Input data files
 19 | Instead of one set of input files, there is one directory of input files that needs to be provided for each planning period or stage (e.g., “inputs/inputs\_p1/” for the first period “inputs/inputs\_p2/” for the second period, etc.). Below we list the additional parameters that must be provided in the corresponding stage-specific input files to instantiate a multi-stage planning problem.

 62 | 
 63 | !!! note "Allowing retrofitted capacity to not contribute to minimum retirement requirements (`myopic=0` only)"
 64 |     Special considerations must be taken into account when utilizing the retrofit module alongside multi-stage planning, particularly when using a non zero value for the `Min_Retired_Cap_MW` column in the `Resource_multistage_data.csv` file.
 65 |     1. When assigning a non-zero value to the `Min_Retired_Cap_MW` column in the `Resource_multistage_data.csv` file, the user can specify whether the model should consider the retrofitted capacity to contribute to the minimum retirement requirement. This is done by setting the `Contribute_Min_Retirement` column to 1 for the retrofit options in the same retrofit cluster (i.e., same `Retrofit_Id`).
 66 |     2. By default, the model assumes that retrofitted capacity contributes to fulfilling minimum retirement requirements.
 67 |     3. Should users wish to exclude retrofitted capacity from contributing to minimum retirement requirements, they must set the `Contribute_Min_Retirement` column to 0 for **all** retrofit options within the same retrofit cluster (i.e., sharing the same `Retrofit_Id`).
 68 |     4. It's important to note that this additional functionality is not currently supported when `myopic=1`. In this case, the retrofit options are only allowed to contribute to the minimum retirement requirement.
 69 | 
 70 |     Example 1: Retrofitted capacity is allowed to contribute to the minimum retirement requirement (i.e., retrofit options in the same cluster (`Retrofit_Id = 1`) all have `Contribute_Min_Retirement = 1`):

108 |     And the case where some retrofit options contribute to the minimum retirement requirement and some do not is not currently supported and will be addressed in a future release.
109 | 
110 | !!! warning "Warning"
111 |     If `New_Build` and `Can_Retire` are both set to 0, the model will not transfer built capacity from one stage to the next, but will instead set capacity to the value of existing capacity from the input files for each stage. Therefore, the user must ensure that the capacity is correctly set in the input files for each stage. Not following this guideline may result in incorrect or unexpected results, particularly when setting a a non-zero value for the `Min_Retired_Cap_MW` parameter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | # Running a case with Time Domain Reduction
 2 | 
 3 | There are two ways to run a case with a reduced (e.g. less than full-year) temporal resolution.
 4 | 1. Let GenX perform the time domain reduction before optimizing.
 5 | 2. Bring your own clustered data
 6 | 
 7 | It's also possible for GenX perform clustering separately from the optimization task. 
 8 | 
 9 | ## Method 1: Let GenX perform the time domain reduction (clustering)
10 | 
11 | Set `TimeDomainReduction: 1 `in the GenX settings for the case.
12 | 
13 | When the case is run (but before the optimization model is built), reduced time series data will be output to a folder within the case, (typically) `TDR_results`. Note that if the data already exists in that folder, it will not be overwritten. If a user wants to change the time domain reduction settings and try again, the folder should be deleted before the case is run.
14 | 
15 | The clustering is done according to the settings in `time_domain_reduction.yml`. These are described in the Inputs section of data_documentation.
16 | 
17 | Time domain clustering can only be performed on data which represents a single contiguous period: typically a year of 8760 or 8736 hours.
18 | 
19 | The header of the file `Demand_data.csv` in the main case folder will typically look like this:
20 | 
21 | ```
22 | ..., Rep_Periods, Timesteps_per_Rep_Period, Sub_Weights, ...
23 |                1,                     8760,        8760,
24 | ```
25 | 
26 | ## Method 2: Bring your own clustered data
27 | 
28 | The second method is to use an external program to generate the reduced ('clustered') time series data. For instance, PowerGenome has a capability to construct GenX cases with clustered time series data.
29 | 
30 | Running using this method **requires** setting `TimeDomainReduction: 0` in the GenX settings for the case.
31 | 
32 | Clustered time series data requires specifying the clustering data using three columns in `Demand_data.csv`: `Rep_Periods`, `Timesteps_per_Rep_Period`, and `Sub_Weights`. For example, a problem representing a full year via 3 representative weeks, and where the first week represents one which is twice as common as the others, would look like
33 | 
34 | ```
35 | ..., Rep_Periods, Timesteps_per_Rep_Period, Sub_Weights, ...
36 |                3,                      168,      4368.0,
37 |                                                  2184.0,
38 |                                                  2184.0,
39 | ```
40 | 
41 | In this example, the first week represents a total of `26*168 = 4368` hours over a full year.
42 | 
43 | The time series data are written in single unbroken columns: in this example, the `Time_Index` ranges from 1 to 504.
44 | 
45 | For problems involving Long Duration Storage, a file `Period_map.csv` is necessary to describe how these representative periods occur throughout the modeled year.
46 | 
47 | See also the [Time-domain reduction](@ref).
48 | 
49 | ## Performing time domain reduction (TDR) separately from optimization
50 | *Added in 0.3.4*
51 | 
52 | It may be useful to perform time domain reduction (TDR) (or "clustering") on a set of inputs before using them as part of full GenX optimization task. For example, a user might want to test various TDR settings and examine the resulting clustered inputs. This can now be performed using the run_timedomainreduction! function.
53 | 
54 | ```
55 | $ julia --project=/home/youruser/GenX
56 | 
57 | julia> using GenX
58 | julia> run_timedomainreduction!("/path/to/case")
59 | ```
60 | 
61 | This function will obey the settings in `path/to/case/settings/time_domain_reduction_settings.yml`. It will output the resulting clustered time series files in the case.
62 | 
63 | Running this function will overwrite these files in the case. This is done with the expectation that the user is trying out various settings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | # Running the model
 2 | 
 3 | When running a new case, it is recommended to create a new folder for the case outside of the `GenX` repository. This folder should contain all the `.csv` input files described in the [GenX Inputs](@ref) section, as well as the `settings` folder containing at least the `genx_settings.yml` and `[solver_name].yml` files.  
 4 | 
 5 | !!! tip "Tip"
 6 |     Check out the [Running GenX](@ref) for additional information on how to run GenX and what happens when you run a case.
 7 | 
 8 | Once the model and the solver are set up, and once all the `.csv` input files are ready, GenX can be run using the following command:
 9 | 
10 | ```
11 | $ julia --project=/path/to/GenX
12 | 
13 | julia> using GenX
14 | julia> run_genx_case!("/path/to/case")
15 | ```
16 | 
17 | where `/path/to/GenX` is the path to the `GenX` repository, and `/path/to/case` is the path to the folder of the case. 
18 | 
19 | Alternatively, you can create a `Run.jl` file with the following code:
20 | 
21 | ```julia
22 | using GenX
23 | run_genx_case!(dirname(@__FILE__))
24 | ```
25 | and and place it in the case folder. Then, you can run the case by opening a terminal and running the following command:
26 | 
27 | ```bash
28 | $ julia --project="/path/to/GenX" /path/to/case/Run.jl
29 | ```
30 | where `/path/to/GenX` is the path to the `GenX` repository, and `/path/to/case` is the path to the folder of the case.
31 | 
32 | The output files will be saved in the `Results` folder inside the case folder. Check out the [GenX Outputs](@ref) section for more information on the output files.
33 | 
34 | !!! note "Slack Variables"
35 |     To run a case with **slack variables**, check out the [Policy Slack Variables](@ref) section.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/docs/src/User_Guide/slack_variables_overview.md:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | # Policy Slack Variables
 2 | _Added in 0.3.5_
 3 | 
 4 | Rather than modeling policy requirements as inflexible constraints, it may be advantageous to instead allow these requirements to be violated at some predetermined cost. 
 5 | This is accomplished via 'slack variables,' which can be used by the model to meet a policy constraint if it cannot be met cost-effectively by normal means. 
 6 | Once the incremental shadow price of meeting a policy constraint rises above a cost threshold set by the user, the model will rely on the slack variable to fill any remaining gap. 
 7 | 
 8 | Using slack variables rather than hard constraints may be useful for GenX users who wish to avoid unexpected infeasibilities resulting from policy requirements that cannot be met. 
 9 | Using slack variables with very high cost thresholds, users can quickly identify specific policy constraints that are effectively infeasible without causing errors. 
10 | 
11 | Slack variables with lower assigned costs can also be used to model policies with built-in cost thresholds, for example a CO2 Cap with a maximum allowable carbon price of \$200/ton. 
12 | They can be activated for each individual policy type available in GenX, including: Capacity Reserve Margins, Energy Share Requirements, CO2 Caps, Minimum Capacity Requirements, and Maximum Capacity Requirements. 
13 | 
14 | ## Running cases with slack variables
15 | 
16 | Slack variables are turned off by default in GenX, but can be automatically activated for each policy type by providing the relevant inputs. 
17 | Slack variables will only be activated when the relevant policy type is itself activated in `GenX_settings.yml`. 
18 | For some policy types, slack variables are activated by providing a new input file, while for others they are activated by modifying an existing file. 
19 | Instructions for each policy type are listed below:
20 | 
21 | ## Capacity Reserve Margin
22 | 
23 | Slack variables for Capacity Reserve Margin constraints are created when GenX detects the presence of the file `Capacity_reserve_margin_slack.csv` in the Inputs folder. 
24 | This file should contain two columns: one titled 'CRM_Constraint' naming the individual Capacity Reserve Margin constraints in the same order in which they are listed in the first row of `Capacity_reserve_margin.csv`, and a second titled 'PriceCap' containing the price thresholds for each constraint. 
25 | The units for these thresholds are $/MW.
26 | 
27 | ## CO2 Cap
28 | Slack variables for CO2 Cap constraints are created when GenX detects the presence of the file `CO2_cap_slack.csv` in the Inputs folder. 
29 | This file should contain two columns: one titled 'CO2_Cap_Constraint' naming the individual CO2 Cap constraints in the same order in which they are listed in the first row of `CO2_Cap.csv`, and a second titled 'PriceCap' containing the price thresholds for each constraint.  The units for these thresholds are $/ton. 
30 | The CO2 Cap slack variable itself is always in units of tons of CO2, even if the CO2 Cap is a rate-based cap.
31 | 
32 | ## Energy Share Requirement
33 | 
34 | Slack variables for Energy Share Requirement constraints are created when GenX detects the presence of the file `Energy_share_requirement_slack.csv` in the Inputs folder. 
35 | This file should contain two columns: one titled 'ESR_Constraint' naming the individual Energy Share Requirement constraints in the same order in which they are listed in the first row of `Energy_share_requirement.csv`, and a second titled 'PriceCap' containing the price thresholds for each constraint. 
36 | The units for these thresholds are \$/MWh.
37 | 
38 | ## Minimum Capacity Requirement
39 | 
40 | Slack variables for Minimum Capacity Requirement constraints are created when GenX detects the presence of a column titled 'PriceCap' in the file `Minimum_capacity_requirement.csv`. 
41 | This column contains the price thresholds for each Minimum Capacity Requirement constraint, in units of \$/MW. 
42 | 
43 | ## Maximum Capacity Requirement
44 | 
45 | Slack variables for Maximum Capacity Requirement constraints are created when GenX detects the presence of a column titled 'PriceCap' in the file `Maximum_capacity_requirement.csv`. 
46 | This column contains the price thresholds for each Maximum Capacity Requirement constraint, in units of \$/MW. 
47 | 
48 | ## Slack Variables Results Files
49 | 
50 | By default, a policy type's result files include the shadow prices for each policy constraint. 
51 | When slack variables are activated, outputs also include the final values of the slack variables (i.e. the amount by which the policy constraint was violated), and the total costs associated with those slack variables. 
52 | These files are named using the convention `X_prices_and_penalties.csv`, where `X` is the name of the relevant policy type.
53 | 
54 | GenX will also print the total cost associated with each activated slack variable type in the file `costs.csv`.
55 | 
56 | ## Slack Variables Example
57 | 
58 | The folder `Example_Systems/SmallNewEngland/ThreeZones_Slack_Variables_Example` contains examples of the input files needed to activate slack variables for each of the policy types in GenX. 
59 | Running this example with a given set of policy constraints activated will generate the relevant slack variables and print their outputs.

 1 | # Solver Configuration
 2 | 
 3 | To define and solve the optimization problems, GenX relies on [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/), a domain-specific modeling language for mathematical optimization written in Julia, and on a variety of open-source and commercial solvers. GenX supports the following solvers:
 4 | 
 5 | - [Cbc](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) (open-source)
 6 | - [Clp](https://github.com/coin-or/Clp) (open-source)
 7 | - [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer) (commercial)
 8 | - [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) (commercial)
 9 | - [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) (open-source)
10 | - [SCIP](https://scip.zib.de/) (open-source)
11 | 
12 | Solver related settings parameters are specified in the appropriate .yml file (e.g. `highs_settings.yml`, `gurobi_settings.yml`, etc.), which should be located in the `settings` folder inside the current working directory (the same `settings` folder where `genx_settings.yml` is located). Settings are specific to each solver. Check the `Example_Systems` folder for examples of solver settings files and parameters. 
13 | 
14 | !!! note "Note"
15 |     GenX supplies default settings for most solver settings in the various solver-specific functions found in the `src/configure_solver/` directory.
16 |     To overwrite default settings, you can specify the below Solver specific settings.
17 | 
18 | The following table summarizes the solver settings parameters and their default/possible values. 
19 | !!! tip "Tip"
20 |     Since each solver has its own set of parameters names, together with a description of the parameter, the table provides a reference to the the corresponding solver specific parameter name.

  3 | ## Introduction
  4 | GenX is a constrained **linear** or **mixed integer linear optimization model** that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.
  5 | 
  6 | Depending on the planning problem or question to be studied, GenX can be configured with varying levels of model resolution and scope, with regards to: 
  7 | 1. Temporal resolution of time series data such as **electricity demand** and **renewable energy availability**; 
  8 | 2. Power system **operational detail** and unit **commitment constraints**; 
  9 | 3. **Geospatial resolution** and **transmission network** representation. 
 10 | 
 11 | The model is also capable of representing a full range of conventional and novel electricity resources, including thermal generators, variable renewable resources (wind and solar), run-of-river, reservoir and pumped-storage hydroelectric generators, energy storage devices, demand-side flexibility, demand response, and several advanced technologies such as long-duration energy storage.
 12 | 
 13 | ## Workflow
 14 | The flexibility of GenX is achieved through a modular and transparent code structure developed in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) + [JuMP](http://jump.dev/). The software workflow includes two main steps: 
 15 | 
 16 | 1. **Model configuration** and **building**: this step involves the specification of the planning problem to be studied, including time dependent data like electricity demand, renewable energy availability and fuel prices, number and type of resources included in the model, graph representation of the transmission network, and the set of constraints and objectives to be imposed.
 17 | 
 18 | 2. **Model execution**: once the model is configured, a solver is called to find the optimal solution to the planning problem. The solution is then post-processed to generate a set of output files that can be used for further analysis.
 19 | 
 20 | The next sections in this guide provide more details on how to perform all the steps in the workflow: 
 21 | 1. [Model settings parameters](@ref): `genx_settings.yml`
 22 | 2. [Solver Configuration](@ref): `[solver_name]_settings.yml`
 23 | 3. [GenX Inputs](@ref)
 24 | 4. [Time-domain reduction](@ref): `time_domain_reduction.yml` (optional)
 25 | 5. [Multi-stage setup](@ref): `multi_stage_settings.yml` (optional)
 26 | 6. [Running the model](@ref)
 27 | 7. [GenX Outputs](@ref)
 28 | 
 29 | ## Details of running a GenX case 
 30 | This section details as to what happens in the process of running a GenX case. As a first step, the GenX package and the desired solver (is it's anyting other than the default solver, HiGHS; for instance, Gurobi) are loaded 
 31 | 
 32 | ```julia
 33 | using GenX
 34 | using Gurobi
 35 | optimizer=Gurobi.Optimizer
 36 | ```
 37 | The next command the user needs to run is the following:
 38 | 
 39 | ```julia
 40 | run_genx_case!("<Location_of_the_case_study_data>", optimizer)
 41 | ```
 42 | Contingent upon whether a single stage model or a multi-stage model is intended to be run, the above function, inturn makes calls to either of these two functions:
 43 | For single-stage case:
 44 | ```julia
 45 | run_genx_case_simple!(case, mysetup, optimizer)
 46 | ```
 47 | From within this function, if time-domain reduction (TDR) is needed, GenX first checks 	whether there already is time domain clustered data (in order to avoid duplication of efforts) by running 
 48 | ```julia
 49 | prevent_doubled_timedomainreduction(case)
 50 | ```
 51 | and if the function
 52 | ```julia
 53 | !time_domain_reduced_files_exist(TDRpath)
 54 | ```
 55 | returns true value, it then runs
 56 | ```julia
 57 | cluster_inputs(case, settings_path, mysetup)
 58 | ```
 59 | to generate the time-domain clustered data for the time-series.
 60 | -OR-
 61 | For multi-stage case:
 62 | 
 63 | ```julia
 64 | run_genx_case_multistage!(case, mysetup, optimizer)
 65 | ```
 66 | In this case also, the TDR clustering is done in a similar way, exxcept for the fact that if TDRSettingsDict["MultiStageConcatenate"] is set to 0, the TDR clustering is done individually for each stage. Otherwise, the clustering is done for all the stages together. The next step is configuring the solver, which is done by
 67 | ```julia
 68 | OPTIMIZER = configure_solver(settings_path, optimizer)
 69 | ```
 70 | The call to configure_solver first gets the particular solver that is being used to solve the particular case at hand, which then calls a function specific to that solver in order to use either the default values of the solver settings parameter or, any other set of values, specified in the settings YAML file for that particular solver. 
 71 | 
 72 | The configuration of solver is followed by loading the input files by running the following function:
 73 | ```julia
 74 | myinputs = load_inputs(mysetup, case)
 75 | ```
 76 | The above function in its turn calls separate functions to load different resources, demand data, fuels data etc. and returns the dictionary myinputs populated by the input data. The next function call is to generate the model 
 77 | ```julia
 78 | time_elapsed = @elapsed EP = generate_model(mysetup, myinputs, OPTIMIZER)
 79 | println("Time elapsed for model building is")
 80 | println(time_elapsed)
 81 | ```
 82 | The above function call instantiates the different decision variables, constraints, and objective function expressions from the input data. It can be seen that we also keep track of the time required to build the model. Follwoing this, the solve_model function makes the call to the solver and return the results as well as the solve time. 
 83 | ```julia
 84 | EP, solve_time = solve_model(EP, mysetup)
 85 | myinputs["solve_time"] = solve_time # Store the model solve time in myinputs
 86 | ```
 87 | For writing the results, we invoke the following function:
 88 | ```julia
 89 | outputs_path = get_default_output_folder(case)
 90 | elapsed_time = @elapsed outputs_path = write_outputs(EP, outputs_path, mysetup, myinputs)
 91 | ```
 92 | The call to the write_outputs() function in turn calls a series of functions (write_capacity, write_power etc.) each of which querries the respective decision variables and creates dataframes, eventually outputting the results to separate CSV files. 
 93 | 
 94 | ## Single and Multi-stage investment planning
 95 | 
 96 | In addition to the standard single-stage planning mode, in which the produces a single snapshot of the minimum-cost generation capacity mix to meet demand at least cost under some pre-specified future conditions, recent improvements in the GenX source code (part of v0.3 release) enable its use for studying **long-term evolution** of the power system across multiple investment stages. GenX can be used to study multi-stage power system planning in the following two ways:
 97 | 
 98 | - The user can formulate and solve a deterministic multi-stage planning problem with perfect foresight i.e. demand, cost, and policy assumptions about all stages are known and exploited to determine the least-cost investment trajectory for the entire period. The solution relies on exploiting the decomposable nature of the multi-stage problem via the implementation of the dual dynamic programming algorithm, described in [Lara et al. 2018 here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221718304466).
 99 | 
100 | - The user can formulate a sequential, myopic multi-stage planning problem, where the model solves a sequence of single-stage investment planning problems wherein investment decisions in each stage are individually optimized to meet demand given assumptions for the current planning stage and with investment decisions from previous stages treated as inputs for the current stage. We refer to this as "myopic" (or shortsighted) mode since the solution does not account for information about future stages in determining investments for a given stage. This version is generally more computationally efficient than the deterministic multi-stage expansion with perfect foresight mode.

2 | 
3 | ## pygenx: Python interface for GenX
4 | 
5 | Python users can now run GenX from a thin-python-wrapper interface, developed by [Daniel Olsen](https://github.com/danielolsen). This tool is called `pygenx` and can be cloned from the github page: [pygenx](https://github.com/danielolsen/pygenx). It needs installation of Julia 1.3 and a clone of GenX repo along with your python installation.
6 | 
7 | ## Simple GenX Case Runner: For automated sequential batch run for GenX
8 | 
9 | It is now possible to run a list of GenX cases as separate batch jobs. Alternatively, they can also be run locally in sequence, as one job. It has been developed by [Jacob Schwartz](https://github.com/cfe316). This tool is called `SimpleGenXCaseRunner` and can be cloned from the github page: [SimpleGenXCaseRunner](https://github.com/cfe316/SimpleGenXCaseRunner)

  1 | # How to contribute to GenX
  2 | 
  3 | ## Introduction
  4 | 
  5 | GenX is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. This guide aims to help you get started with GenX and explain how to contribute to the project. In general, the two main ways to contribute to GenX are:
  6 | 
  7 | 1. Use of [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) to report bugs and request new features
  8 | 2. Use of [GitHub pull requests (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to submit code changes
  9 | 
 10 | !!! tip
 11 |     We encourage every contributors to read this [guide](https://github.com/SciML/ColPrac), which contains some guidelines on how to contribute to a collaborative project like GenX.
 12 | 
 13 | The following sections describe in more detail how to work with GenX resources and how to add a new resource to GenX.
 14 | 
 15 | ## Style guide
 16 | GenX project follows the [SciML Style Guide](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLStyle). We encourage contributors to follow this style guide when submitting code changes to GenX. Before submitting a new PR, please run the following command to format a file or a directory:
 17 | ```julia
 18 | julia> using JuliaFormatter
 19 | julia> format("path_to_directory", SciMLStyle(), verbose=true)
 20 | ```
 21 | or
 22 | ```julia
 23 | julia> using JuliaFormatter
 24 | julia> format("path_to_file.jl", SciMLStyle(), verbose=true)
 25 | ```
 26 | The GitHub repository of GenX is configured to verify the code style of each PR and will automatically provide comments to assist you in formatting the code according to the style guide.
 27 | 
 28 | ## GenX resources
 29 | 
 30 | In GenX, a resource is defined as an instance of a `GenX resource type`, a subtype of an `AbstractResource`. This allows the code to use multiple dispatch and define a common interface (behavior) for all resources in the code. 
 31 | Type hierarchy of GenX resources:
 32 | 
 33 | ![Type hierarchy of GenX resources](./assets/type_hierarchy.png)
 34 | 
 35 | !!! note
 36 |     All the interface and utility functions available for resources are defined in the [resources.jl](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/develop/src/model/resources/resources.jl) file. 
 37 | 
 38 | The set of all the resource types available in GenX are contained in the `resource_types` `Tuple` defined at the of the `resources.jl` file. During the initialization process, GenX reads the input data files and creates a new instance of the corresponding resource type for each row in the file. 
 39 | 
 40 | ### Resource design principles
 41 | 
 42 | Resources in GenX are constructed from a set of input files (in `.csv` format, one for each type of resource) located in the `resources` folder inside the `case` folder. Each row in one of these files defines a new resource instance, and each column corresponds to an attribute of that resource type. 
 43 | 
 44 | !!! warning
 45 |     The first column of each input data file should be called `Resource` and contain a unique identifier for each resource.
 46 | 
 47 | For example, in the case below, the files `Hydro.csv`, `Thermal.csv`, `Vre.csv`, and `Storage.csv` contain the resource data for the hydro, thermal, VRE, and storage resources, respectively. These files are read by GenX during the initialization process and used to create the corresponding resource instances.
 48 | 
 49 | ```
 50 | case_folder
 51 |     ├── resources
 52 |     │   ├── Hydro.csv
 53 |     │   ├── Thermal.csv
 54 |     │   ├── Vre.csv
 55 |     │   └── Storage.csv
 56 |     ├── system
 57 |     │   └── Generators_variability.csv
 58 |     //
 59 |     ├── setting
 60 |     │   └── genx_settings.yml
 61 |     └── Run.jl
 62 | ```
 63 | 
 64 | When loading the file `Thermal.csv` below, GenX will create three new resources of type `Thermal` and assign the values of the attributes of each resource from the columns in the input data file:
 65 | 
 66 | ```
 67 | Thermal.csv
 68 | 
 69 |  resource            │ zone  │ existing_cap_mw │ inv_cost_per_mwyr │ heat_rate_mmbtu_per_mwh │
 70 |  String              │ Int64 │ Float64         │ Float64           │ Float64                 │
 71 | ────────────────────-┼───────┼─────────────────┼───────────────────┼─────────────────────────│
 72 |  NG_combined_cycle_1 │ 1     │ 100.0           │ 239841            │ 7.89                    │
 73 |  NG_combined_cycle_2 │ 2     │ 200.0           │ 0.0               │ 8.29                    │
 74 |  Biomass             │ 3     │ 200.0           │ 81998             │ 9.9                     │
 75 | ```
 76 | These three resources, together with all the other resources in the data files, will be stored in the GenX `inputs` dictionary with the key `RESOURCES`.
 77 | 
 78 | ```julia
 79 | julia> gen = inputs["RESOURCES"]
 80 | julia> length(gen)  # returns the number of resources in the model
 81 | julia> thermal(gen)  # returns the indices of all thermal resources (Vector{Int64})
 82 | julia> gen.Thermal  # returns the thermal resources (Vector{Thermal})
 83 | julia> gen.Thermal == gen[thermal(gen)]  # returns true
 84 | ```
 85 | 
 86 | ### Working with GenX resources
 87 | To access the attributes of each resource, you can either use a function interface or the standard `.` notation. 
 88 | 
 89 | For example, let's assume that `thermal_gen` is the vector of the three `Thermal` resources created from the input data file `Thermal.csv` shown above. 
 90 | 
 91 | !!! note
 92 |     In the example below, we create the vector `thermal_gen` manually. However, in practice, this vector is automatically created by GenX when loading the input data file `Thermal.csv`.
 93 | 
 94 | ```@meta
 95 | DocTestSetup = quote
 96 |     using GenX: AbstractResource, Thermal, resource_name, existing_cap_mw, inv_cost_per_mwyr, ids_with, ids_with_positive, ids_with_nonneg, ids_with_policy, resource_id, esr, haskey
 97 | end
 98 | ```
 99 | 
100 | ```jldoctest example_thermal
101 | julia> thermal_gen = [Thermal(Dict(:resource => "NG_combined_cycle_1", 
102 |                                 :existing_cap_mw => 100.0, 
103 |                                 :inv_cost_per_mwyr => 239841, 
104 |                                 :heat_rate_mmbtu_per_mwh => 7.89,
105 |                                 :id => 23,
106 |                                 :max_cap_mw => 100.0,
107 |                                 :esr_1 => 1,)),
108 |                         Thermal(Dict(:resource => "NG_combined_cycle_2",
109 |                                 :existing_cap_mw => 200.0,
110 |                                 :inv_cost_per_mwyr => 0.0,
111 |                                 :heat_rate_mmbtu_per_mwh => 8.29,
112 |                                 :max_cap_mw => 0,
113 |                                 :id => 24)),
114 |                         Thermal(Dict(:resource => "Biomass",
115 |                                 :existing_cap_mw => 200.0,
116 |                                 :inv_cost_per_mwyr => 81998,
117 |                                 :heat_rate_mmbtu_per_mwh => 9.9, 
118 |                                 :max_cap_mw => 0,
119 |                                 :lds => 1,
120 |                                 :new_build => 1,
121 |                                 :id => 25))];
122 | ```
123 | 
124 | To access the attributes of the resources in `thermal_gen`, you can either use the function interfaces defined in `resources.jl` (recommended), or you can use the standard `.` notation:
125 | 
126 | ```jldoctest example_thermal
127 | julia> resource_name(thermal_gen[1])
128 | "NG_combined_cycle_1"
129 | julia> resource_name.(thermal_gen)
130 | 3-element Vector{String}:
131 |  "NG_combined_cycle_1"
132 |  "NG_combined_cycle_2"
133 |  "Biomass"
134 | julia> existing_cap_mw(thermal_gen[1])
135 | 100.0
136 | julia> existing_cap_mw.(thermal_gen)
137 | 3-element Vector{Float64}:
138 |  100.0
139 |  200.0
140 |  200.0
141 | julia> thermal_gen[1].existing_cap_mw
142 | 100.0
143 | ```
144 | 
145 | Moreover, inside the `resources.jl` file, there is a set of utility functions to work with all the resources and that can be used as building blocks to create more complex functions:
146 | 
147 | - [`Base.get`](@ref): Returns the value of the attribute `sym` of the resource `r`. If the attribute is not defined for the resource, it returns the `default` value of that attribute.
148 | 
149 | Example: 
150 | ```jldoctest example_thermal
151 | julia> get(thermal_gen[1], :existing_cap_mw, 0)
152 | 100.0
153 | julia> get(thermal_gen[1], :new_build, 0)
154 | 0

253 | ## How to add a new resource to GenX
254 | ### Overview
255 | GenX is designed to be modular and highly flexible to comply with the rapidly changing electricity landscape. For this reason, adding a new resource to GenX is relatively straightforward. This guide will walk you through the steps to do it.
256 | 
257 | !!! tip
258 |     Before you start, ensure you have read the section of the documentation about [1.4 Resources input files](@ref). This will help you understand the data format that GenX expects for each resource and where to place the input data files. 
259 | 
260 | 
261 | ### Step 1: Define the new resource data type
262 | The first step to add a new resource to GenX is to create a new GenX resource type. This is done by adding a new element to the `resource_types` list of symbols defined at the top of the [resources.jl](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/develop/src/model/resources/resources.jl) file. This list contains the names of all the resource types available in GenX. 
263 | 
264 | For example, to add a new resource type called `new_resource`, you would need to add a new `Symbol`, `:NewResource` to the `resource_types` list:
265 | ```julia
266 | const resource_types = (:Thermal,
267 |                         :Vre,
268 |                         :Hydro,
269 |                         :Storage,
270 |                         :MustRun,
271 |                         :FlexDemand,
272 |                         :VreStorage,
273 |                         :Electrolyzer,
274 |                         :NewResource)
275 | ```
276 | We encourage you to use `CamelCase` for the name of the new resource type.
277 | 
278 | The lines right after the `resource_types` list automatically create a new `struct` (composite type) for the new resource type. More importantly, the new resource type will be defined as a subtype of the GenX `AbstractResource` type. This is important because it allows the code to use multiple dispach and define a common interface (behavior) for all resources in GenX. For instance, the `resource_id()` function will return the `id` of any resource in GenX, regardless of its type (and therefore will automatically work for the newly created `new_resource`).
279 | 
280 | ### Step 2: Add the filename of the new resource type to GenX
281 | 
282 | In GenX, the attributes of a resource are automatically defined from the columns of the corresponding input data file (e.g., `Thermal.csv` file for the `Thermal` resources, `Hydro.csv` file for the `Hydro` resource, etc). The first column of these files should be called `Resource` and contain a unique identifier for each resource. The rest of the columns in the input data file will be used to define the attributes of the new resource type. 
283 | 
284 | So, the second step to add a new resource type to GenX is to add the filename of the input data file to GenX. The list of input data files that GenX loads during the initialization process are defined at the top of the [`load_resource_data.jl`](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/main/src/load_inputs/load_resources_data.jl)
285 | file, inside an internal function called `_get_resource_info()`. This function returns a `NamedTuple` called `resource_info` with the name of the input data file and the name of the resource type for each resource that is available in GenX. 
286 | 
287 | To add the new resource type to GenX, add a new item to `resource_info`, where the first field is the name of the input data file and the second is the name of the resource type that was created in Step 1. The names in `resource_info` are only used to make the code more readable and are arbitrary. 
288 | 
289 | For example, if you are adding a new resource type called `new_resource`, you would need to add the following line to the `resource_info`: `new_resource = (filename="New_resource.csv", type=NewResource)`, as follows: 
290 | 
291 | ```julia
292 | function _get_resource_info()
293 |     resource_info = (
294 |         hydro   = (filename="Hydro.csv", type=Hydro),
295 |         thermal = (filename="Thermal.csv", type=Thermal),
296 |         vre     = (filename="Vre.csv", type=Vre),
297 |         storage = (filename="Storage.csv", type=Storage),
298 |         flex_demand  = (filename="Flex_demand.csv", type=FlexDemand),
299 |         must_run = (filename="Must_run.csv", type=MustRun),
300 |         electrolyzer = (filename="Electrolyzer.csv", type=Electrolyzer),
301 |         vre_stor = (filename="Vre_stor.csv", type=VreStorage)
302 |         new_resource = (filename="New_resource.csv", type=NewResource)
303 |     )
304 |     return resource_info
305 | end
306 | ```
307 | With this simple edit, whenever the file `New_resource.csv` is found in the input data folder, GenX will automatically perform the following steps:
308 | 
309 | 1. Load the new resource input file,
310 | 2. Create a new instance of the `NewResource` type for each row in the input data file,
311 | 3. Define the attributes of each `NewResource` from the columns in the input data file,
312 | 4. Populate the attributes of each `NewResource` with the values read from the input data file.
313 | 5. Add the new resources to the vector of resources in the model.
314 | 
315 | For example, if the input data file `New_resource.csv` contains the following data:
316 | ```
317 | New_resource.csv
318 | 
319 |  Resource │ Zone  | Exisiting_capacity | attribute_1 | attribute_2
320 |  String   │ Int64 | Float64            | Float64     | Float64
321 | ──────────┼───────┼────────────────────┼─────────────┼────────────
322 |  new_res1 │ 1     │ 100.0              │ 6.2         │ 0.4
323 |  new_res2 │ 1     │ 200.0              │ 0.1         │ 4.0
324 |  new_res3 │ 2     │ 300.0              │ 2.0         │ 0.1
325 | ```
326 | GenX will create three new resources of type `NewResource` with the following attributes:
327 | - `resource`: `String` with the name of the resource (e.g., `new_res1`, `new_res2`, `new_res3`)
328 | - `zone`: `Int64` with the zone of the resource (e.g., `1`, `1`, `2`)
329 | - `existing_capacity`: `Float64` with the existing capacity of the resource (e.g., `100.0`, `200.0`, `300.0`)
330 | - `attribute_1`: `Float64` with the value of `attribute_1` (e.g., `6.2`, `0.1`, `2.0`)
331 | - `attribute_2`: `Float64` with the value of `attribute_2` (e.g., `0.4`, `4.0`, `0.1`)
332 | 
333 | 
334 | See Step 3 for more details on how to work with the new resource type.
335 | 
336 | !!! warning
337 |     Each resource type must contain a `Resource` attribute. This attribute should be `String` that uniquely identifies the resource. 
338 | 
339 | ### Step 3: Work with the new resource type
340 | Once the new resource type has been defined and added to GenX, you can work with it as you would with any other resource type. To improve the robustness and readability of the code, we recommend that you define getter functions for the new attributes of the new resource type (e.g., a function `zone(r) = r.zone` to get the zone of the resource `r`). These functions can be defined in the `resources.jl` file. However, this is not strictly necessary, and you can access the attributes of the new resource type directly using the standard `.` notation:
341 | 
342 | !!! tip
343 |     To simplify the creation of getter functions for the new resource type, you can use the `@interface` macro available in GenX. This macro automatically creates a new function with the same name as the attribute and which returns the value of the attribute. For example, if you want to create a getter function for the `attribute_1` of the `NewResource` type, these two ways are equivalent:
344 |     ```julia
345 |     julia> default_attribute_1 = 0.0    # default value for attribute_1
346 |     julia> attribute_1(res::NewResource) = get(res, :attribute_1, default_attribute_1)
347 |     attribute_1 (generic function with 1 method)
348 |     julia> @interface(attribute_1, 0.0, NewResource)
349 |     attribute_1 (generic function with 1 method)
350 |     ```
351 |     And then:
352 |     ```julia
353 |     julia> attribute_1(new_res1)
354 |     6.2
355 |     julia> new_res1.attribute_1
356 |     6.2
357 |     ```
358 | 
359 | ```@meta
360 | DocTestSetup = nothing
361 | ```

 6 | ### Welcome to the GenX documentation! 
 7 | 
 8 | ## What is GenX?
 9 | 
10 | GenX is a highly-configurable, [open source](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/main/LICENSE) electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape.
11 | 
12 | The model was [originally developed](https://energy.mit.edu/publication/enhanced-decision-support-changing-electricity-landscape/) by [Jesse D. Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/jenkins) and [Nestor A. Sepulveda](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/nestor-sepulveda/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by [a team of contributors](https://energy.mit.edu/genx/#team) at the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins), MIT (led by [Ruaridh MacDonald](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/ruaridh-macdonald/)), NYU (led by [Dharik Mallapragada](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/dharik-mallapragada)), and Binghamton University (led by [Neha Patankar](https://www.binghamton.edu/ssie/people/profile.html?id=npatankar)). 
13 | 
14 | GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.
15 | 
16 | GenX features a modular and transparent code structure developed in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) + [JuMP](http://jump.dev/). The model is designed to be highly flexible and configurable for use in a variety of applications from academic research and technology evaluation to public policy and regulatory analysis and resource planning. See the **User Guide** for more information on how to use GenX and the **Developer Guide** for more information on how to contribute to GenX.
17 | 
18 | ## Uses
19 | 
20 | From a centralized planning perspective, the GenX model can help to determine the investments needed to supply future electricity demand at minimum cost, as is common in least-cost utility planning or integrated resource planning processes. In the context of liberalized markets, the model can be used by regulators and policy makers for indicative energy planning or policy analysis in order to establish a long-term vision of efficient market and policy outcomes. The model can also be used for techno-economic assessment of emerging electricity generation, storage, and demand-side resources and to enumerate the effect of parametric uncertainty (e.g., technology costs, fuel costs, demand, policy decisions) on the system-wide value or role of different resources.

22 | ## Roadmap of the Documentation: A Guide for the Users and Developers
23 | 
24 | This section provides a quick guidance as to how to navigate through the different parts of the documentation pages; what the different sections contain, and how to relate it to the different parts of the GenX code-base. 
25 | 
26 | This page serves as a gentle introduction to what GenX is meant for and what it does. 
27 | 
28 | The next subsection, [Installation Guide](@ref) goes over how to download and install GenX and also how to download and install the Julia programming language (in which GenX is written) and the different open-source non-commercial freely available solvers, as well as the commercial solvers and the respective JuMP interfaces. This subsection also goes over installing the environment dependencies and instantiating a virtual environment.
29 | 
30 | We also mention the shortcomings of GenX and some third party extentions in the next couple subsections
31 | 
32 | The next section is **Getting Started** goes over [Running GenX](@ref) and has two subsections. The first subsection, [Example cases](@ref), gives a walkthrough through some predefined example systems and how to run GenX for those and interpret the results. It also tells how to run GenX for a user-defined case. The subsection [Using commercial solvers: Gurobi or CPLEX](@ref) talks specifically about how to run GenX with commercial solvers like Gurobi and CPLEX that are absolutely indispensable for solving large cases. 
33 | 
34 | The third section, **Tutorial** starts with [GenX Tutorials](@ref) and gives a comprehensive tour of the different steps that are involved when a GenX capacity expansion simulation is run. It consists of 6 tutorial sections, each of which highlights the different important aspects of model construction and run of GenX. The different sections are configuring the GenX settings, visualizing the network, time domain reduction, generating the model, solving the model, and adjusting the different solver settings.
35 | 
36 | The **User Guide**, which the fourth section ([User Guide](@ref)) goes into the depths and details of the different steps and the settings and input parameters from the previous Tutorial section. The sections starts off with an overview of the workflow in GenX, briefing about the different steps (some of which we encountered in the Tutorials) of running GenX model. It then explains the different parameters of settings, policy, time-domain reduction, model structure, and output. Following this, the next subsection explains the different solver settings parameters of the different solvers. The next subsection goes over the different input CSV files and the different fields that are used there. The following two subsections are devoted to Time Domain Reduction (TDR). The first one walks through and explains the different settings parameters for TDR and the second one explains the couple different ways to run TDR for GenX and what exactly happens when we run TDR. The next four subsections, respectively, explains the different parameters, inputs, and outputs, and what happens when Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA), Multi-stage model, slack variables for policies (when we want to satisfy policy constraints in a soft manner by adding penalty of violation in the objective function), and Method of Morris. Finally, the last two sections are about the different steps involved while solving the model and the explanation of different output fields for both the default settings and user-specific settings. 
37 | 
38 | The **Model Concept and Overview** section first introduces the GenX model in [GenX Model Introduction](@ref) and talks about its scope. It also introduces the notations, the objective function, and the power balance constraints. This is the first section which delves into the theoretical and mathematical details of the model, which is the most important one for model developers.
39 | 
40 | The **Model Reference**, which is the sixth section delves deep into the GenX model and introduces the mathematical formulation, while discussing the physical interpretations of all the different parts of the GenX model. This section starts off with discussing the [Core](@ref) of the model, which models the Discharge, Non-Served Energy, Operational Reserves, Transmission, Unit Commitment, CO2, and Fuel. The different parts of the model consists of the different tyoe of generating resources (thermal, hydro, VRE, storage etc.), transmission network (modeling of flows as well as losses), demand modeling, operating reserves, unit commitment, different policies (such as CO2 constraint, capacity reserve margin, energy share requirement, min and max cap requirement etc.). This section also mentions about the different Julia functions (or methods) used for loading the input files, building the model, solving it, and generating the output files. Also, this is the section that explains the internal details of the Julia functions used for TDR, MGA, Method of Morris, Multi-stage modeling, and the several utility functions used throughout the GenX code-base. 
41 | 
42 | The seventh section, **Public API Reference** [Public Documentation](@ref) is for describing the functions that are directly accessible to an external program from GenX (like loading inputs, generating output, running TDR script etc.) and how an external "client" code can access the GenX features, if the user desires to run his/her own code instead of the Run.jl provided by us.
43 | 
44 | The eighth section, **Third Party Extension** [Additional Third Party Extensions to GenX](@ref) mentions about Pygenx, a Python interface for GenX, that was built by Daniel Olsen and GenX case runner for automated batch running, built by Jacob Schwartz.
45 | 
46 | Finally, the ninth and last section, **Developer Docs** [How to contribute to GenX](@ref) talks about the resource organization in GenX, how to add a new user-defined resource, and also several JuMP functions that are used as utility throughout the GenX code-base.

 1 | # Installation Guide
 2 | This guide will walk you through the steps to install Julia, the GenX package, and the required dependencies to run GenX.
 3 | 
 4 | ## Installing Julia
 5 | GenX (v0.4.4) runs on Julia v1.6 through v1.9, with a minimum version of the package [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) v1.1.1. Julia v1.10 and v1.11 are also supported. However, we recently noticed a decline in performance with Julia v1.10, which is currently under investigation. Therefore, we recommend using Julia v1.9, particularly for very large cases. To install Julia, please follow the instructions on the [Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
 6 | 
 7 | !!! note "Note" 
 8 |     We recommend the users to stick to a particular version of Julia to run GenX. If however, the users decide to switch between versions, it's very important to delete the old `Manifest.toml` file and do a fresh build of GenX.
 9 | 
10 | ## Downloading GenX and installing dependencies
11 | After installing Julia, you can download GenX by either cloning the repository or downloading the zip file from the [GenX GitHub page](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX). For this tutorial it will be assumed to be within your home directory: `/home/youruser/GenX`.
12 | Once you have downloaded GenX, you can install the dependencies by following the steps below:
13 | 
14 | 1\. Start a terminal and navigate into the `GenX` folder.
15 | 
16 | 2\. Type `julia --project=.` to start an instance of the `julia` kernel with the `project` set to the current folder. The flag `--project=.` indicates that Julia will activate the project environment using the `Project.toml` present in the current folder, `.`. If running on Windows, the location of Julia can also be specified as e.g., `C:\julia-1.6.0\bin\julia.exe --project=.`.
17 | 
18 | !!! tip "Tip"
19 |     The file `Project.toml` in the parent directory lists all of the dependencies and their versions needed to run GenX. You can see all of the packages installed in your Julia environment and their version numbers by running `pkg> status` or `pkg> st` on the package manager command line in the Jula REPL (for more information on the Julia package manager, read the documentation for the [Pkg.jl](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/) or for the [Julia standard library](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/)).
20 | 
21 | !!! tip "Tip" 
22 |     `julia --project` is a shortcut for `julia --project=.`
23 | 
24 | 3\. Type `]` to bring up the package system `(GenX) pkg >` prompt. This indicates that the GenX project was detected. 
25 | 
26 | !!! warning "Warning"
27 |     If you see `(@v1.6) pkg>` as the prompt, then the `project` was not successfully set.
28 | 
29 | 4\. Type `instantiate` from the `(GenX) pkg` prompt.
30 |    
31 | !!! note "Note for Windows users" 
32 |     On Windows there is an issue with the prepopulated `MUMPS_seq_jll v5.5.1` that prevents compilation of the solvers. To avoid this issue type `add MUMPS_seq_jll@5.4.1` after running instantiate.
33 | 
34 | 5\. Type `st` to check that the dependecies have been installed. If there is no error, it has been successful.
35 | 
36 | !!! tip "Tip" 
37 |     Type the back key to come back to the `julia>` prompt from the package manager.
38 | 
39 | The above steps are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

45 | *Figure 2. Creating the Julia environment and installing dependencies from Project.toml file from inside the GenX folder: Step 5*
46 | 
47 | ## Installing solvers
48 | GenX requires a solver to be installed to solve the optimization problem. By default, GenX uses one of the following open-source freely available solvers:
49 | 
50 | 1. [HiGHS](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl) for linear programming and MILP (default solver)
51 | 2. [Clp](https://github.com/jump-dev/Clp.jl) for linear programming (LP) problems
52 | 3. [Cbc](https://github.com/jump-dev/Cbc.jl) for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems
53 | 
54 | We also provide the option to use one of these two commercial solvers: 
55 | 4. [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com)
56 | 5. [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer).
57 | 
58 | !!! note "Note on commercial solvers"
59 |     Using Gurobi and CPLEX requires a valid license on the host machine.
60 | 
61 | ## Notes on previous versions of GenX
62 | For those users who has previously cloned GenX, and has been running it successfully so far, and therefore might be unwilling to run it on the latest version of Julia: please look into the GitHub branch, [old_version](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/old_version).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | # Limitations of the GenX Model
 2 | 
 3 | While the benefits of an openly available generation and transmission expansion model are high, many approximations have been made due to missing data or to manage computational tractability. The assumptions of the GenX model are listed below. It serves as a caveat to the user and as an encouragement to improve the approximations.
 4 | 
 5 | #### 1. Time period
 6 | GenX makes the simplifying assumption that each time period contains n copies of a single, representative year. GenX optimizes generation and transmission capacity for just this characteristic year within each time period, assuming the results for different years in the same time period are identical. However, the GenX objective function accounts only for the cost of the final model time period.
 7 | 
 8 | #### 2. Cost
 9 | The GenX objective function assumes that the cost of powerplants is specified in the unit of currency per unit of capacity. GenX also assumes that the capital cost of technologies is paid through loans.
10 | 
11 | #### 3.Market
12 | GenX is a bottom-up (technology-explicit), partial equilibrium model that assumes perfect markets for commodities. In other words, each commodity is produced such that the sum of producer and consumer surplus is maximized.
13 | 
14 | #### 4. Technology
15 | Behavioral response and acceptance of new technology are often modeled simplistically as a discount rate or by externally fixing the technology capacity. A higher, technology-specific discount rate represents consumer reluctance to accept newer technologies.
16 | 
17 | #### 5. Uncertainty
18 | Because each model realization assumes a particular state of the world based on the input values drawn, the parameter uncertainty is propagated through the model in the case of myopic model runs.
19 | 
20 | #### 6. Decision-making
21 | 
22 | GenX assumes rational decision making, with perfect information and perfect foresight, and simultaneously optimizes all decisions over the user-specified time horizon.
23 | 
24 | #### 7. Demand
25 | GenX assumes price-elastic demand segments that are represented using piece-wise approximation rather than an inverse demand curve to keep the model linear.
26 |

 1 | ## pygenx: Python interface for GenX
 2 | 
 3 | Python users can now run GenX from a thin-python-wrapper interface, developed by [Daniel Olsen](https://github.com/danielolsen). This tool is called `pygenx` and can be cloned from the github page: [pygenx](https://github.com/danielolsen/pygenx). It needs installation of Julia 1.3 and a clone of GenX repo along with your python installation. 
 4 | 
 5 | ## Simple GenX Case Runner: For automated sequential batch run for GenX
 6 | 
 7 | It is now possible to run a list of GenX cases as separate batch jobs. Alternatively, they can also be run locally in sequence, as one job. It has been developed by [Jacob Schwartz](https://github.com/cfe316). This tool is called `SimpleGenXCaseRunner` and can be cloned from the github page: [SimpleGenXCaseRunner](https://github.com/cfe316/SimpleGenXCaseRunner)

/example_systems/1_three_zones/README.md:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1 | # Three Zones
 2 | 
 3 | **Three Zones**, a one-year example with hourly resolution, contains zones representing Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. The ten represented resources include natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage.
 4 | 
 5 | To run the model, first navigate to the example directory:
 6 | 
 7 | - Using a Julia REPL:
 8 | 
 9 | ```bash
10 | $ julia
11 | julia> cd("example_systems/1_three_zones/")
12 | ```
13 | 
14 | - Using a terminal or command prompt:
15 | ```bash
16 | $ cd example_systems/1_three_zones/
17 | ``` 
18 |    
19 | Next, ensure that your settings in `settings/genx_settings.yml` are correct. The default settings use the solver `HiGHS`, time domain reduced input data (`TimeDomainReduction: 1`) and minimum capacity requirement policy (`MinCapReq: 1`) as specified in the `policies/Minimum_capacity_requirement.csv` file. Other optional policies include a capacity reserve margin, an energy share requirement (such as renewable portfolio standard (RPS) or clean electricity standard (CES) policies), a CO2 emissions cap, and a maximum capacity requirement policy (see the documentation for more details). For this example, a rate-based carbon cap of 50 gCO<sub>2</sub> per kWh is specified in the `policies/CO2_cap.csv` input file.
20 | 
21 | Once the settings are confirmed, run the model with the `Run.jl` script in the example directory:
22 | 
23 | - Using a Julia REPL (recommended)
24 | ```julia
25 | julia> include("Run.jl")
26 | ```
27 | - Using a terminal or command prompt:
28 | ```bash
29 | $ julia Run.jl
30 | ```
31 | 
32 | Once the model has completed, results will write to the `results` directory.

 1 | # Three Zones Multi-Stage
 2 | 
 3 | This is a toy multi-stage example with hourly resolution which contains zones representing Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine. It is designed to show how to run multi-stage investment planning models. The ten represented resources include natural gas, solar PV, wind, and lithium-ion battery storage.
 4 | 
 5 | To run the model, first navigate to the example directory:
 6 | 
 7 | - Using a Julia REPL:
 8 | 
 9 | ```bash
10 | $ julia
11 | julia> cd("example_systems/6_three_zones_w_multistage/")
12 | ```
13 | 
14 | - Using a terminal or command prompt:
15 | ```bash
16 | $ cd example_systems/6_three_zones_w_multistage/
17 | ``` 
18 |    
19 | Next, ensure that your settings in `settings/genx_settings.yml` are correct. The default settings use the solver HiGHS and time domain reduced input data (`TimeDomainReduction: 1`). 
20 | 
21 | The `settings/multi_stage_settings.yml` file contains settings parameters specific to multi-stage modeling. This example is configured for three model periods (`NumPeriods: 3`) of 10 years in length each (`PeriodLength: 10`).
22 | 
23 | Multi-period modeling in GenX requires a separate set of model inputs for each period to be modeled, which are located in the directories `inputs/inputs_p

         is the number of the model period. Although separate model periods can have different costs and policy parameters, the resources names and types, specified in each resource `.csv` files (included in the `resources` folder) must be identical across model periods. In addition, multi-stage modeling with a single zone requires an additional input file, `Resource_multistage_data.csv`, also located in the `resources` directory, which contains fields related to resource lifetimes, capital recovery periods, and endogenous retirements.
24 | 
25 | A rate-based carbon cap becomes more stringent across the three model periods and for each zone, declining from of 1,000 gCO<sub>2</sub> per kWh in the first period, 500  gCO<sub>2</sub> per kWh in the second period, and  50 gCO<sub>2</sub> per kWh in the third period, as specified in the `policies/CO2_cap.csv` input files in `inputs/inputs_p1`, `inputs/inputs_p2`, and `inputs/inputs_p3` respectively.
26 | 
27 | Once the settings are confirmed, run the model with the `Run.jl` script in the example directory:
28 | 
29 | - Using a Julia REPL (recommended)
30 | ```julia
31 | julia> include("Run.jl")
32 | ```
33 | - Using a terminal or command prompt:
34 | ```bash
35 | $ julia Run.jl
36 | ```
37 | 
38 | Once the model has completed, results will write to the `results` directory.

  6 | We apply the Method of Morris developed by [Morris, M., 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1269043) in order to identify the input parameters that produce the largest change on total system cost. Method of Morris falls under the simplest class of one-factor-at-a-time (OAT) screening techniques. It assumes l levels per input factor and generates a set of trajectories through the input space. As such, the Method of Morris generates a grid of uncertain model input parameters, $x_i, i=1, ..., k$,, where the range $[x_i^{-}, x_i^{+}$ of each uncertain input parameter i is split into l intervals of equal length. Each trajectory starts at different realizations of input parameters chosen at random and are built by successively selecting one of the inputs randomly and moving it to an adjacent level. These trajectories are used to estimate the mean and the standard deviation of each input parameter on total system cost. A high estimated mean indicates that the input parameter is important; a high estimated standard deviation indicates important interactions between that input parameter and other inputs.

  4 | We have implemented an updated Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) Algorithm proposed by [Berntsen and Trutnevyte (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217304097) to generate a set of feasible, near cost-optimal technology portfolios. This algorithm was developed by [Brill Jr, E. D., 1979](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.25.5.413) and introduced to energy system planning by [DeCarolia, J. F., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988310000721).
  5 | 
  6 | To create the MGA formulation, we replace the cost-minimizing objective function of GenX with a new objective function that creates multiple generation portfolios by zone. We further add a new budget constraint based on the optimal objective function value $f^*$ of the least-cost model and the user-specified value of slack $\delta$. After adding the slack constraint, the resulting MGA formulation is given as (`MGAAnnualGeneration = 0` in the genx_settings.yml file, or not set):

 20 | 
 21 | If the users set `MGAAnnualGeneration = 1` in the genx_settings.yml file, the MGA formulation is given as:
 22 | ```math
 23 | \begin{aligned}
 24 | \text{max/min} \quad
 25 | 	&\sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}}\sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}} \beta_{z,r}^{k}P_{z,r}\\

 28 | 	& f \leq f^* + \delta \\
 29 | 	&Ax = b
 30 | \end{aligned}
 31 | ```
 32 | where, $\beta_{z,r}$ is a random objective function coefficient betwen $[0,1]$ for MGA iteration $k$. $\Theta_{y,t,z,r}$ is a generation of technology $y$ in zone $z$ in time period $t$ that belongs to a resource type $r$. We aggregate $\Theta_{y,t,z,r}$ into a new variable $P_{z,r}$ that represents total generation from technology type $r$ in a zone $z$. 
 33 | 
 34 | In the second constraint in both the above formulations, $\delta$ denote the increase in budget from the least-cost solution and $f$ represents the expression for the total system cost. The constraint $Ax = b$ represents all other constraints in the power system model. We then solve the formulation with minimization and maximization objective function to explore near optimal solution space.

  3 | 
  4 | This function creates expressions to account for CO2 emissions as well as captured and sequestrated 
  5 | CO2 from thermal generators. It also has the capability to model the negative CO2 emissions 
  6 | from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. 
  7 | 
  8 | ***** Expressions *****
  9 | 
 10 | For thermal generators which combust fuels (e.g., coal, natural gas, and biomass), the net CO2 
 11 | emission to the environment is a function of fuel consumption, CO2 emission factor, CO2 capture 
 12 | fraction, and whether the feedstock is biomass. Biomass is a factor in this equation because 
 13 | biomass generators are assumed to generate zero net CO2 emissions, or negative net CO2 emissions 
 14 | in the case that the CO2 they emit is captured and sequestered underground.
 15 | 
 16 | If a user wishes to represent a generator that combusts biomass, then in the resource .csv files,
 17 | the "Biomass" column (boolean, 1 or 0), which represents if a generator $y$ uses biomass or not, should be set to 1.
 18 | The CO2 emissions from such a generator will be assumed to be zero without CCS and negative with CCS.
 19 | 
 20 | The CO2 emissions from generator $y$ at time $t$ are determined by total fuel 
 21 | consumption (MMBTU) multiplied by the CO2 content of the fuel (tCO2/MMBTU), and by 
 22 | (1 - Biomass [0 or 1] - CO2 capture fraction [a fraction, between 0 - 1]). 
 23 | The CO2 capture fraction could be differernt during the steady-state and startup events
 24 | (generally startup events have a lower CO2 capture fraction), so we use distinct CO2 capture fractions
 25 | to determine the emissions. 
 26 | In short, the CO2 emissions for a generator depend on the CO2 emission factor from fuel combustion,
 27 | the CO2 capture fraction, and whether the generator uses biomass.
 28 | 
 29 | ```math
 30 | \begin{aligned}
 31 | eEmissionsByPlant_{g,t} = (1-Biomass_y-  CO2\_Capture\_Fraction_y) * vFuel_{y,t}  * CO2_{content} + (1-Biomass_y-  CO2\_Capture\_Fraction\_Startup_y) * eStartFuel_{y,t} * CO2_{content} 
 32 | \hspace{1cm} \forall y \in G, \forall t \in T, Biomass_y \in {{0,1}}
 33 | \end{aligned}
 34 | ```
 35 | 
 36 | Where $Biomass_y$ represents a binary variable (1 or 0) that determines if the generator $y$ 
 37 | uses biomass, and $CO2\_Capture\_Fraction_y$ represents a fraction for CO2 capture rate.
 38 | 
 39 | In addition to CO2 emissions, for generators with a non-zero CO2 capture rate, we also 
 40 | determine the amount of CO2 being captured and sequestered. The CO2 emissions from 
 41 | generator $y$ at time $t$, denoted by $eEmissionsCaptureByPlant_{g,t}$, are determined by 
 42 | total fuel consumption (MMBTU) multiplied by the $CO_2$ content of the fuel (tCO2/MMBTU), 
 43 | times CO2 capture rate. 
 44 | 
 45 | ```math
 46 | \begin{aligned}
 47 | eEmissionsCaptureByPlant_{g,t} = CO2\_Capture\_Fraction_y * vFuel_{y,t}  * CO2_{content} +  CO2\_Capture\_Fraction\_Startup_y *  eStartFuel_{y,t} * CO2_{content}

  4 | The total capacity of each resource is defined as the sum of the existing capacity plus the newly invested capacity minus any retired capacity.

  3 |     fuel!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  4 | 
  5 | This function creates expressions to account for total fuel consumption (e.g., coal, 
  6 | natural gas, hydrogen, etc). It also has the capability to model heat rates that are
  7 | a function of load via a piecewise-linear approximation. See also the [`thermal!`](@ref) page.
  8 | 
  9 | **Expressions**
 10 | 
 11 | Users have two options to model the fuel consumption as a function of power generation: 
 12 | (1). Use a constant heat rate, regardless of the minimum load or maximum load; and 
 13 | 
 14 | (2). Use the PiecewiseFuelUsage-related parameters to model the fuel consumption via a 
 15 | piecewise-linear approximation of the heat rate curves. By using this option, users can represent 
 16 | the fact that most generators have a decreasing heat rate as a function of load.
 17 | 
 18 | (1). Constant heat rate: 
 19 | The fuel consumption for power generation $vFuel_{y,t}$ is determined by power generation 
 20 | ($vP_{y,t}$) mutiplied by the corresponding heat rate ($Heat\_Rate_y$). 
 21 | The fuel costs for power generation and start fuel for a plant $y$ at time $t$, 
 22 | denoted by $eCFuelOut_{y,t}$ and $eFuelStart$, are determined by fuel consumption ($vFuel_{y,t}$ 
 23 | and $eStartFuel$) multiplied by the fuel costs (\$/MMBTU)
 24 | 
 25 | (2). Piecewise-linear approximation: 
 26 | With this formulation, the heat rate of generators becomes a function of load.
 27 | In reality this relationship takes a nonlinear form, but we model it
 28 | through a piecewise-linear approximation:
 29 | 
 30 | ```math
 31 | \begin{aligned}
 32 | vFuel_{y,t} >= vP_{y,t} * h_{y,x} + U_{g,t}* f_{y,x}
 33 | \hspace{1cm} \forall y \in G, \forall t \in T, \forall x \in X
 34 | \end{aligned}
 35 | ```
 36 | Where $h_{y,x}$ represents the heat rate slope for generator $y$ in segment $x$ [MMBTU/MWh],
 37 |  $f_{y,x}$ represents the heat rate intercept (MMBTU) for a generator $y$ in segment $x$ [MMBTU],
 38 | and $U_{y,t}$ represents the commitment status of a generator $y$ at time $t$. These parameters
 39 | are optional inputs to the resource .csv files. 
 40 | When Unit commitment is on, if a user provides slope and intercept, the standard heat rate 
 41 | (i.e., Heat\_Rate\_MMBTU\_per\_MWh) will not be used. When unit commitment is off, the model will 
 42 | always use the standard heat rate.
 43 | The user should determine the slope and intercept parameters based on the Cap\_Size of the plant. 
 44 | For example, when a plant is operating at the full load (i.e., power output equal to the Cap\_Size),
 45 | the fuel usage determined by the effective segment divided by Cap\_Size should be equal to the 
 46 | heat rate at full-load.
 47 | 
 48 | Since fuel consumption and fuel costs are postive, the optimization will force the fuel usage
 49 | to be equal to the highest fuel usage segment for any given value of vP.
 50 | When the power output is zero, the commitment variable $U_{g,t}$ will bring the intercept 
 51 | to be zero such that the fuel consumption is zero when thermal units are offline.
 52 | 
 53 | In order to run piecewise fuel consumption module,
 54 | the unit commitment must be turned on (UC = 1 or 2), and users should provide $PWFU_{y_0}$, $PWFU_{Slope_i}$ and 
 55 | $PWFU_{Intercept_i}$ for at least one segment ($PWFU$ refers to Piece Wise Fuel Usage) (Refer to

 57 | 
 58 | To enable resources to use multiple fuels during both startup and normal operational processes, three additional variables were added: 
 59 | fuel $i$ consumption by plant $y$ at time $t$ ($vMulFuel_{y,i,t}$); startup fuel consumption for single-fuel plants ($vStartFuel_{y,t}$); 
 60 | and startup fuel consumption for multi-fuel plants ($vMulStartFuel_{y,i,t}$). By making startup fuel consumption variables, the model can choose the startup fuel to meet the constraints.    
 61 |     
 62 | For plants using multiple fuels:
 63 |     
 64 | During startup, heat input from multiple startup fuels are equal to startup fuel requirements in plant $y$ at time $t$: $StartFuelMMBTUperMW$ $\times$ $Capsize$.
 65 | ```math
 66 | \begin{aligned}
 67 | \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I} } vMulStartFuels_{y, i, t}= CapSize_{y} \times StartFuelMMBTUperMW_{y} \times vSTART_{y,t}
 68 | \end{aligned}
 69 | ```
 70 | During normal operation, the sum of fuel consumptions from multiple fuels dividing by the correspnding heat rates, respectively, is equal to $vPower$ in plant $y$ at time $t$. 
 71 | ```math
 72 | \begin{aligned}
 73 | \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I} } \frac{vMulFuels_{y, i, t}} {HeatRate_{i,y} } = vPower_{y,t}
 74 | \end{aligned}
 75 | ```
 76 | There are also constraints on how much heat input each fuel can provide, which are specified by $MinCofire$ and $MaxCofire$.
 77 | ```math
 78 | \begin{aligned}
 79 | vMulFuels_{y, i, t} >= vPower_{y,t} \times MinCofire_{i}
 80 | \end{aligned}   
 81 | \begin{aligned}
 82 | vMulFuels_{y, i, t} <= vPower_{y,t} \times MaxCofire_{i}

  2 |     non_served_energy!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | This function defines the non-served energy/curtailed demand decision variable
  4 | $\Lambda_{s,t,z} \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}, z \in \mathcal{Z}$,
  5 | representing the total amount of demand curtailed in demand segment $s$ at
  6 | time period $t$ in zone $z$.
  7 | The first segment of non-served energy, $s=1$, is used to denote the cost of
  8 | involuntary demand curtailment (e.g. emergency load shedding or rolling blackouts),
  9 | specified as the value of $n_{1}^{slope}$.
 10 | Additional segments, $s \geq 2$ can be used to specify a segment-wise approximation of a
 11 | price elastic demand curve, or segments of price-responsive curtailable demands
 12 | (aka demand response).
 13 | Each segment denotes a price/cost at which the segment of demand is willing to curtail
 14 | consumption, $n_{s}^{slope}$, representing the marginal willingness to pay for electricity
 15 | of this segment of demand (or opportunity cost incurred when demand is not served) and a
 16 | maximum quantity of demand in this segment, $n_{s}^{size}$, specified as a share of demand
 17 | in each zone in each time step, $D_{t,z}.$ Note that the current implementation assumes
 18 | demand segments are an equal share of hourly demand in all zones.
 19 | This function defines contributions to the objective function from the cost of non-served
 20 | energy/curtailed demand from all demand curtailment segments $s \in \mathcal{S}$ over all
 21 | time periods $t \in \mathcal{T}$ and all zones $z \in \mathcal{Z}$:
 22 | ```math
 23 | \begin{aligned}
 24 | 	Obj_{NSE} =
 25 | 	\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S} } \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}}\omega_{t} \times n_{s}^{slope} \times \Lambda_{s,t,z}
 26 | \end{aligned}
 27 | ```
 28 | Contributions to the power balance expression from non-served energy/curtailed demand
 29 | from each demand segment $s \in \mathcal{S}$ are also defined as:
 30 | ```math
 31 | \begin{aligned}
 32 | 	PowerBal_{NSE} =
 33 | 	\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S} } \Lambda_{s,t,z}
 34 | 		\hspace{4 cm}  \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 35 | \end{aligned}
 36 | ```
 37 | **Bounds on curtailable demand**
 38 | Demand curtailed in each segment of curtailable demands $s \in \mathcal{S}$ cannot exceed
 39 | a maximum allowable share of demand:
 40 | ```math
 41 | \begin{aligned}
 42 | 	\Lambda_{s,t,z} \leq (n_{s}^{size} \times D_{t,z})
 43 | 	\hspace{4 cm}  \forall s \in \mathcal{S}, t \in \mathcal{T}, z\in \mathcal{Z}
 44 | \end{aligned}
 45 | ```
 46 | Additionally, total demand curtailed in each time step cannot exceed total demand:
 47 | ```math
 48 | \begin{aligned}
 49 | 	\sum_{s \in \mathcal{S} } \Lambda_{s,t,z} \leq D_{t,z}

 24 | 
 25 | This function establishes several different versions of contingency reserve requirement expression, $CONTINGENCY$ used in the operational_reserves_core() function below.
 26 | 
 27 | Contingency operational reserves represent requirements for upward ramping capability within a specified time frame to compensated for forced outages or unplanned failures of generators or transmission lines (e.g. N-1 contingencies).
 28 | 
 29 | There are three options for the $Contingency$ expression, depending on user settings:
 30 | 	1. a static contingency, in which the contingency requirement is set based on a fixed value (in MW) specified in the '''Operational_reserves.csv''' input file;
 31 | 	2. a dynamic contingency based on installed capacity decisions, in which the largest 'installed' generator is used to determine the contingency requirement for all time periods; and
 32 | 	3. dynamic unit commitment based contingency, in which the largest 'committed' generator in any time period is used to determine the contingency requirement in that time period.
 33 | 
 34 | Note that the two dynamic contigencies are only available if unit commitment is being modeled.
 35 | 
 36 | **Static contingency**
 37 | Option 1 (static contingency) is expressed by the following constraint:
 38 | ```math
 39 | \begin{aligned}
 40 | 	Contingency = \epsilon^{contingency}
 41 | \end{aligned}
 42 | ```
 43 | where $\epsilon^{contingency}$ is static contingency requirement in MWs.
 44 | 
 45 | **Dynamic capacity-based contingency**
 46 | Option 2 (dynamic capacity-based contingency) is expressed by the following constraints:
 47 | ```math
 48 | \begin{aligned}
 49 | 	& Contingency \geq \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \times \alpha^{Contingency,Aux}_{y,z} & \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, z \in \mathcal{Z}\\
 50 | 	& \alpha^{Contingency,Aux}_{y,z} \leq \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z} & \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, z \in \mathcal{Z}\\
 51 | 	& \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z} \leq M_y \times \alpha^{Contingency,Aux}_{y,z} & \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, z \in \mathcal{Z}\\
 52 | \end{aligned}
 53 | ```
 54 | 
 55 | where $M_y$ is a `big M' constant equal to the largest possible capacity that can be installed for generation cluster $y$, and $\alpha^{Contingency,Aux}_{y,z} \in [0,1]$ is a binary auxiliary variable that is forced by the second and third equations above to be 1 if the total installed capacity $\Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z} > 0$ for any generator $y \in \mathcal{UC}$ and zone $z$, and can be 0 otherwise. Note that if the user specifies contingency option 2, and is also using the linear relaxation of unit commitment constraints, the capacity size parameter for units in the set $\mathcal{UC}$ must still be set to a discrete unit size for this contingency to work as intended.
 56 | 
 57 | **Dynamic commitment-based contingency**
 58 | Option 3 (dynamic commitment-based contingency) is expressed by the following set of constraints:
 59 | ```math
 60 | \begin{aligned}
 61 | 	& Contingency \geq \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \times Contingency\_Aux_{y,z,t} & \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, z \in \mathcal{Z}\\
 62 | 	& Contingency\_Aux_{y,z,t} \leq \nu_{y,z,t} & \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, z \in \mathcal{Z}\\
 63 |     & \nu_{y,z,t} \leq M_y \times Contingency\_Aux_{y,z,t} & \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, z \in \mathcal{Z}\\
 64 | \end{aligned}
 65 | ```
 66 | 
 67 | where $M_y$ is a `big M' constant equal to the largest possible capacity that can be installed for generation cluster $y$, and $Contingency\_Aux_{y,z,t} \in [0,1]$ is a binary auxiliary variable that is forced by the second and third equations above to be 1 if the commitment state for that generation cluster $\nu_{y,z,t} > 0$ for any generator $y \in \mathcal{UC}$ and zone $z$ and time period $t$, and can be 0 otherwise. Note that this dynamic commitment-based contingency can only be specified if discrete unit commitment decisions are used (e.g. it will not work if relaxed unit commitment is used).

144 | 	operational_reserves_core!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
145 | 
146 | This function creates decision variables related to frequency regulation and reserves provision and constraints setting overall system requirements for regulation and operating reserves.
147 | 
148 | **Regulation and reserves decisions**
149 | $f_{y,t,z} \geq 0$ is the contribution of generation or storage resource $y \in Y$ in time $t \in T$ and zone $z \in Z$ to frequency regulation
150 | 
151 | $r_{y,t,z} \geq 0$ is the contribution of generation or storage resource $y \in Y$ in time $t \in T$ and zone $z \in Z$ to operating reserves up
152 | 
153 | We assume frequency regulation is symmetric (provided in equal quantity towards both upwards and downwards regulation). To reduce computational complexity, operating reserves are only modeled in the upwards direction, as downwards reserves requirements are rarely binding in practice.
154 | 
155 | Storage resources ($y \in \mathcal{O}$) have two pairs of auxilary variables to reflect contributions to regulation and reserves when charging and discharging, where the primary variables ($f_{y,z,t}$ and $r_{y,z,t}$) becomes equal to sum of these auxilary variables.
156 | 
157 | Co-located VRE-STOR resources are described further in the reserves function for colocated VRE and storage resources (```vre_stor_operational_reserves!()```).
158 | 
159 | **Unmet operating reserves**
160 | 
161 | $unmet\_rsv_{t} \geq 0$ denotes any shortfall in provision of operating reserves during each time period $t \in T$
162 | 
163 | There is a penalty $C^{rsv}$ added to the objective function to penalize reserve shortfalls, equal to:
164 | 
165 | ```math
166 | \begin{aligned}
167 | 	C^{rvs} = \sum_{t \in T} \omega_t \times unmet\_rsv_{t}
168 | \end{aligned}
169 | ```
170 | 
171 | **Frequency regulation requirements**
172 | 
173 | Total requirements for frequency regulation (aka primary reserves) in each time step $t$ are specified as fractions of hourly demand (to reflect demand forecast errors) and variable renewable avaialblity in the time step (to reflect wind and solar forecast errors).
174 | 
175 | ```math
176 | \begin{aligned}
177 | & \sum_{y \in Y, z \in Z} f_{y,t,z} \geq \epsilon^{demand}_{reg} \times \sum_{z \in Z} \mathcal{D}_{z,t} + \epsilon^{vre}_{reg} \times (\sum_{z \in Z} \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} \times \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z} \\

179 | \end{aligned}
180 | ```
181 | where $\mathcal{D}_{z,t}$ is the forecasted electricity demand in zone $z$ at time $t$ (before any demand flexibility);
182 | $\rho^{max}_{y,z,t}$ is the forecasted capacity factor for standalone variable renewable resources $y \in VRE$ and zone $z$ in time step $t$;
183 | $\rho^{max,pv}_{y,z,t}$ is the forecasted capacity factor for co-located solar PV resources $y \in \mathcal{VS}^{pv}$ and zone $z$ in time step $t$;
184 | $\rho^{max,wind}_{y,z,t}$ is the forecasted capacity factor for co-located wind resources $y \in \mathcal{VS}^{pv}$ and zone $z$ in time step $t$;
185 | $\Delta^{\text{total,pv}}_{y,z}$ is the total installed capacity of co-located solar PV resources $y \in \mathcal{VS}^{pv}$ and zone $z$;
186 | $\Delta^{\text{total,wind}}_{y,z}$ is the total installed capacity of co-located wind resources $y \in \mathcal{VS}^{wind}$ and zone $z$;
187 | and $\epsilon^{demand}_{reg}$ and $\epsilon^{vre}_{reg}$ are parameters specifying the required frequency regulation as a fraction of forecasted demand and variable renewable generation.
188 | 
189 | **Operating reserve requirements**
190 | 
191 | Total requirements for operating reserves in the upward direction (aka spinning reserves or contingency reserces or secondary reserves) in each time step $t$ are specified as fractions of time step's demand (to reflect demand forecast errors) and variable renewable avaialblity in the time step (to reflect wind and solar forecast errors) plus the largest planning contingency (e.g. potential forced generation outage).
192 |

  2 | 	transmission!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | This function establishes decisions, expressions, and constraints related to transmission power flows between model zones and associated transmission losses (if modeled).
  4 | 
  5 | Power flow and transmission loss terms are also added to the power balance constraint for each zone:
  6 | ```math
  7 | \begin{aligned}
  8 | &	- \sum_{l\in \mathcal{L}}{(\varphi^{map}_{l,z} \times \Phi_{l,t})} - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{l\in \mathcal{L}}{(\varphi^{map}_{l,z} \times \beta_{l,t}(\cdot))}
  9 | \end{aligned}
 10 | ```
 11 | Power flows, $\Phi_{l,t}$, on each line $l$ into or out of a zone (defined by the network map $\varphi^{map}_{l,z}$), are considered in the demand balance equation for each zone. By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign is used for this term. Losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone. The losses function $\beta_{l,t}(\cdot)$ will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see below).
 12 | **Accounting for Transmission Between Zones**
 13 | Power flow, $\Phi_{l,t}$, on each line (or more likely a `path' aggregating flows across multiple parallel lines) is constrained to be less than or equal to the line's power transfer capacity, $\varphi^{cap}_{l}$, plus any transmission capacity added on that line (for lines eligible for expansion in the set $\mathcal{E}$). The additional transmission capacity, $\bigtriangleup\varphi^{cap}_{l} $, is constrained by a maximum allowed reinforcement, $\overline{\bigtriangleup\varphi^{cap}_{l}}$, for each line $l \in \mathcal{E}$.
 14 | ```math
 15 | \begin{aligned}
 16 | 	% trasmission constraints
 17 | 	&-\varphi^{cap}_{l} \leq  \Phi_{l,t} \leq \varphi^{cap}_{l} , &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L},\forall t  \in \mathcal{T}\\
 18 | \end{aligned}
 19 | ```
 20 | **Accounting for Transmission Losses**
 21 | Transmission losses due to power flows can be accounted for in three different ways. The first option is to neglect losses entirely, setting the value of the losses function to zero for all lines at all hours. The second option is to assume that losses are a fixed percentage, $\varphi^{loss}_{l}$, of the magnitude of power flow on each line, $\mid \Phi_{l,t} \mid$ (e.g., losses are a linear function of power flows). Finally, the third option is to calculate losses, $\ell_{l,t}$, by approximating a quadratic-loss function of power flow across the line using a piecewise-linear function with total number of segments equal to the size of the set $\mathcal{M}$.
 22 | ```math
 23 | \begin{aligned}
 24 | %configurable losses formulation
 25 | 	& \beta_{l,t}(\cdot) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if~} \text{losses.~0} \\ \\ \varphi^{loss}_{l}\times \mid \Phi_{l,t} \mid & \text{if~} \text{losses.~1} \\ \\ \ell_{l,t} &\text{if~} \text{losses.~2} \end{cases}, &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L},\forall t  \in \mathcal{T}
 26 | \end{aligned}
 27 | ```
 28 | For the second option, an absolute value approximation is utilized to calculate the magnitude of the power flow on each line (reflecting the fact that negative power flows for a line linking nodes $i$ and $j$ represents flows from node $j$ to $i$ and causes the same magnitude of losses as an equal power flow from $i$ to $j$). This absolute value function is linearized such that the flow in the line must be equal to the subtraction of the auxiliary variable for flow in the positive direction, $\Phi^{+}_{l,t}$, and the auxiliary variable for flow in the negative direction, $\Phi^{-}_{l,t}$, of the line. Then, the magnitude of the flow is calculated as the sum of the two auxiliary variables. The sum of positive and negative directional flows are also constrained by the line flow capacity.
 29 | ```math
 30 | \begin{aligned}
 31 | % trasmission losses simple
 32 | 	&\Phi_{l,t} =  \Phi^{+}_{l,t}  - \Phi^{-}_{l,t}, &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T}\\
 33 | 	&\mid \Phi_{l,t} \mid =  \Phi^{+}_{l,t}  + \Phi^{-}_{l,t}, &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T}\\
 34 | 	&\Phi^{+}_{l,t}  + \Phi^{-}_{l,t} \leq \varphi^{cap}_{l}, &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T}
 35 | \end{aligned}
 36 | ```
 37 | If discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled, ``phantom losses'' can be observed wherein the auxiliary variables for flows in both directions ($\Phi^{+}_{l,t}$ and $\Phi^{-}_{l,t}$) are both increased to produce increased losses so as to avoid cycling a thermal generator and incurring start-up costs or opportunity costs related to minimum down times. This unrealistic behavior can be eliminated via inclusion of additional constraints and a set of auxiliary binary variables, $ON^{+}_{l,t} \in {0,1} \forall l \in \mathcal{L}$. Then the following additional constraints are created:
 38 | ```math
 39 | \begin{aligned}
 40 | 	\Phi^{+}_{l,t} \leq TransON^{+}_{l,t},  &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T}\\
 41 | 	\Phi^{-}_{l,t} \leq \varphi^{cap}_{l} -TransON^{+}_{l,t}, &\quad  \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T}

 44 | where $TransON^{+}_{l,t}$ is a continuous variable, representing the product of the binary variable $ON^{+}_{l,t}$ and the expression, $\varphi^{cap}_{l}$. This product cannot be defined explicitly, since it will lead to a bilinear expression involving two variables. Instead, we enforce this definition via the Glover's Linearization as shown below (also referred McCormick Envelopes constraints for bilinear expressions, which is exact when one of the variables is binary).
 45 | ```math
 46 | \begin{aligned}
 47 | 	TransON^{+}_{l,t} \leq  (\overline{varphi^{cap}_{l}} + \overline{\bigtriangleup\varphi^{cap}_{l}}) \times TransON^{+}_{l,t},  &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T} \\
 48 | 	TransON^{+}_{l,t} \leq  \varphi^{cap}_{l},  &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T} \\
 49 | 	TransON^{+}_{l,t} \geq \varphi^{cap}_{l} - (\overline{\varphi^{cap}_{l}} + \overline{\bigtriangleup\varphi^{cap}_{l}}) \times(1- TransON^{+}_{l,t}),  &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T} \\

 52 | These constraints permit only the positive or negative auxiliary flow variables to be non-zero at a given time period, not both.
 53 | For the third option, losses are calculated as a piecewise-linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows. In order to do this, we represent the absolute value of the line flow variable by the sum of positive stepwise flow variables $(\mathcal{S}^{+}_{m,l,t}, \mathcal{S}^{-}_{m,l,t})$, associated with each partition of line losses computed using the corresponding linear expressions. This can be understood as a segmentwise linear fitting (or first order approximation) of the quadratic losses function. The first constraint below computes the losses a the accumulated sum of losses for each linear stepwise segment of the approximated quadratic function, including both positive domain and negative domain segments. A second constraint ensures that the stepwise variables do not exceed the maximum size per segment. The slope and maximum size for each segment are calculated as per the method in \cite{Zhang2013}.
 54 | ```math
 55 | \begin{aligned}
 56 | 	& \ell_{l,t} = \frac{\varphi^{ohm}_{l}}{(\varphi^{volt}_{l})^2}\bigg( \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M}}( S^{+}_{m,l}\times \mathcal{S}^{+}_{m,l,t} + S^{-}_{m,l}\times \mathcal{S}^{-}_{m,l,t}) \bigg), &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T} \\
 57 | 	& \text{\quad Where:} \\
 58 | 	& \quad S^{+}_{m,l} = \frac{2+4 \times \sqrt{2}\times (m-1)}{1+\sqrt{2} \times (2 \times M-1)} (\overline{\varphi^{cap}_{l}} + \overline{\bigtriangleup\varphi^{cap}_{l}}) &\quad \forall m \in [1 \colon M], l \in \mathcal{L}  \\
 59 | 	& \quad S^{-}_{m,l} = \frac{2+4 \times \sqrt{2}\times (m-1)}{1+\sqrt{2} \times (2 \times M-1)} (\overline{\varphi^{cap}_{l}} + \overline{\bigtriangleup\varphi^{cap}_{l}}) &\quad \forall m \in [1 \colon M], l \in \mathcal{L}\\
 60 | 	& \\

 62 | 	& \text{\quad Where:} \\

 64 | 	\frac{2 \times \sqrt{2} }{1+\sqrt{2} \times (2 \times M-1)} (\overline{\varphi^{cap}_{l}} + \overline{\bigtriangleup\varphi^{cap}_{l}}) & \text{if~} m > 1 \end{cases}
 65 | \end{aligned}
 66 | ```
 67 | Next, a constraint ensures that the sum of auxiliary segment variables ($m \geq 1$) minus the "zero" segment (which allows values to go into the negative domain) from both positive and negative domains must total the actual power flow across the line, and a constraint ensures that the sum of negative and positive flows do not exceed the flow capacity of the line.
 68 | ```math
 69 | \begin{aligned}
 70 | 	&\sum_{m \in [1:M]} (\mathcal{S}^{+}_{m,l,t}) - \mathcal{S}^{+}_{0,l,t} =  \Phi_{l,t}, &\quad \forall l \in \mathcal{L}, \forall t  \in \mathcal{T}\\
 71 | 	&\sum_{m \in [1:M]} (\mathcal{S}^{-}_{m,l,t}) - \mathcal{S}^{-}_{0,l,t}  =  - \Phi_{l,t}
 72 | \end{aligned}
 73 | ```
 74 | As with losses option 2, this segment-wise approximation of a quadratic loss function also permits 'phantom losses' to avoid cycling thermal units when discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled. In this case, the additional constraints below are also added to ensure that auxiliary segments variables do not exceed maximum value per segment and that they are filled in order; i.e., one segment cannot be non-zero unless prior segment is at its maximum value. Binary constraints deal with absolute value of power flow on each line. If the flow is positive, $\mathcal{S}^{+}_{0,l,t}$ must be zero; if flow is negative, $\mathcal{S}^{+}_{0,l,t}$ must be positive and takes on value of the full negative flow, forcing all $\mathcal{S}^{+}_{m,l,t}$ other segments ($m \geq 1$) to be zero. Conversely, if the flow is negative, $\mathcal{S}^{-}_{0,l,t}$ must be zero; if flow is positive, $\mathcal{S}^{-}_{0,l,t}$ must be positive and takes on value of the full positive flow, forcing all $\mathcal{S}^{-}_{m,l,t}$ other segments ($m \geq 1$) to be zero. Requiring segments to fill in sequential order and binary variables to ensure variables reflect the actual direction of power flows are both necessary to eliminate ``phantom losses'' from the solution. These constraints and binary decisions are ommited if the model is fully linear.

 29 | 
 30 | The first summation represents the fixed costs of generation/discharge over all zones and technologies, which refects the sum of the annualized capital cost, $\pi^{INVEST}_{y,z}$, times the total new capacity added (if any),  plus the Fixed O&M cost, $\pi^{FOM}_{y,z}$, times the net installed generation capacity, $\overline{\Omega}^{size}_{y,z} \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}$ (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).
 31 | 
 32 | The second summation corresponds to the fixed cost of installed energy storage capacity and is summed over only the storage resources. This term includes the sum of the annualized energy capital cost, $\pi^{INVEST,energy}_{y,z}$, times the total new energy capacity added (if any), plus the Fixed O&M cost, $\pi^{FOM, energy}_{y,z}$, times the net installed energy storage capacity, $\Delta^{total}_{y,z}$ (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).
 33 | 
 34 | The third summation corresponds to the fixed cost of installed charging power capacity and is summed over only over storage resources with independent/asymmetric charge and discharge power components ($\mathcal{O}^{asym}$). This term includes the sum of the annualized charging power capital cost, $\pi^{INVEST,charge}_{y,z}$, times the total new charging power capacity added (if any), plus the Fixed O&M cost, $\pi^{FOM, energy}_{y,z}$, times the net installed charging power capacity, $\Delta^{total}_{y,z}$ (e.g., existing capacity less retirements plus additions).
 35 | 
 36 | The fourth and fifth summations corresponds to the operational cost across all zones, technologies, and time steps. The fourth summation represents the sum of fuel cost, $\pi^{FUEL}_{y,z}$ (if any), plus variable O&M cost, $\pi^{VOM}_{y,z}$ times the energy generation/discharge by generation or storage resources (or demand satisfied via flexible demand resources, $y\in\mathcal{DF}$) in time step $t$, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$, and the weight of each time step $t$, $\omega_t$, where $\omega_t$ is equal to 1 when modeling grid operations over the entire year (8760 hours), but otherwise is equal to the number of hours in the year represented by the representative time step, $t$ such that the sum of $\omega_t \forall t \in T = 8760$, approximating annual operating costs. The fifth summation represents the variable charging O&M cost, $\pi^{VOM,charge}_{y,z}$ times the energy withdrawn for charging by storage resources (or demand deferred by flexible demand resources) in time step $t$ , $\Pi_{y,z,t}$ and the annual weight of time step $t$,$\omega_t$.
 37 | 
 38 | The sixth summation represents the total cost of unserved demand across all segments $s$ of a segment-wise price-elastic demand curve, equal to the marginal value of consumption (or cost of non-served energy), $n_{s}^{slope}$, times the
 39 | amount of non-served energy, $\Lambda_{y,z,t}$, for each segment on each zone during each time step (weighted by $\omega_t$).
 40 | 
 41 | The seventh summation represents the total cost of not meeting hourly operating reserve requirements, where $\pi^{unmet}_{rsv}$ is the cost penalty per unit of non-served reserve requirement, and $r^{unmet}_t$ is the amount of non-served reserve requirement in each time step (weighted by $\omega_t$).
 42 | 
 43 | The eighth summation corresponds to the startup costs incurred by technologies to which unit commitment decisions apply (e.g. $y \in \mathcal{UC}$), equal to the cost of start-up, $\pi^{START}_{y,z}$, times the number of startup events, $\chi_{y,z,t}$, for the cluster of units in each zone and time step (weighted by $\omega_t$).
 44 | 
 45 | The last term corresponds to the transmission reinforcement or construction costs, for each transmission line in the model. Transmission reinforcement costs are equal to the sum across all lines of the product between the transmission reinforcement/construction cost, $\pi^{TCAP}_{l}$, times the additional transmission capacity variable, $\bigtriangleup\varphi^{max}_{l}$. Note that fixed O\&M and replacement capital costs (depreciation) for existing transmission capacity is treated as a sunk cost and not included explicitly in the GenX objective function.
 46 | 
 47 | In summary, the objective function can be understood as the minimization of costs associated with five sets of different decisions: (1) where and how to invest on capacity, (2) how to dispatch or operate that capacity, (3) which consumer demand segments to serve or curtail, (4) how to cycle and commit thermal units subject to unit commitment decisions, (5) and where and how to invest in additional transmission network capacity to increase power transfer capacity between zones. Note however that each of these components are considered jointly and the optimization is performed over the whole problem at once as a monolithic co-optimization problem.
 48 | 
 49 | **Power Balance**
 50 | 
 51 | The power balance constraint of the model ensures that electricity demand is met at every time step in each zone. As shown in the constraint, electricity demand, $D_{t,z}$, at each time step and for each zone must be strictly equal to the sum of generation, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$, from thermal technologies ($\mathcal{H}$), curtailable VRE ($\mathcal{VRE}$), must-run resources ($\mathcal{MR}$), and hydro resources ($\mathcal{W}$). At the same time, energy storage devices ($\mathcal{O}$) can discharge energy, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$ to help satisfy demand, while when these devices are charging, $\Pi_{y,z,t}$, they increase demand. For the case of flexible demand resources ($\mathcal{DF}$), delaying demand (equivalent to charging virtual storage), $\Pi_{y,z,t}$, decreases demand while satisfying delayed demand (equivalent to discharging virtual demand), $\Theta_{y,z,t}$, increases demand. Price-responsive demand curtailment, $\Lambda_{s,z,t}$, also reduces demand. Finally, power flows, $\Phi_{l,t}$, on each line $l$ into or out of a zone (defined by the network map $\varphi^{map}_{l,z}$), are considered in the demand balance equation for each zone. By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign in the below constraint. At the same time losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone. The losses function $\beta_{l,t}(\cdot)$ will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see Transmission section).

 2 | 	cap_reserve_margin!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
 3 | Instead of modeling capacity reserve margin requirement (a.k.a. capacity market or resource adequacy requirement) using an annual constraint,
 4 | we model each requirement with hourly constraint by simulating the activation of the capacity obligation.
 5 | We define capacity reserve margin constraint for subsets of zones,
 6 | $z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CRM}_{p}$, and each subset stands for a
 7 | locational deliverability area (LDA) or a reserve sharing group.
 8 | For thermal resources, the available capacity is the total capacity in the LDA derated by
 9 | the outage rate, $\epsilon_{y,z,p}^{CRM}$.
10 | For variable renewable energy ($y \in \mathcal{VRE}$), the available capacity is the
11 | maximum discharge potential in time step $t$ derated by the derating factor.
12 | For standalone storage and co-located VRE and storage resources
13 | ($y \in \mathcal{O} \cup \mathcal{VS}$) the available capacity is the net injection
14 | into the transmission network plus the net virtual injection corresponding to charge held
15 | in reserve, derated by the derating factor.
16 | For information on how each component contributes to the capacity reserve margin formulation for co-located VRE and storage resources, see ```vre_stor_capres!()```.
17 | For flexible demand resources ($y \in \mathcal{DF}$), the available capacity is the net
18 | injection into the transmission network in time step $t$ derated by the derating factor,
19 | also stored in the parameter, $\epsilon_{y,z,p}^{CRM}$.
20 | If the imported capacity is eligible to provide capacity to the CRM constraint,
21 | the inbound powerflow on all lines $\mathcal{L}_{p}^{in}$ in time step $t$ will be derated
22 | to form the available capacity from outside of the LDA.
23 | The reverse is true as well: the outbound derated powerflow on all lines
24 | $\mathcal{L}_{p}^{out}$ in time step $t$ is taken out from the total available capacity.
25 | The derating factor should be equal to the expected availability of the resource during
26 | periods when the capacity reserve constraint is binding (e.g. accounting for forced outages
27 | during supply constrained periods) and is similar to derating factors used in the capacity
28 | markets.
29 | On top of the flexible demand resources, demand curtailment can also provide capacity
30 | (i.e., demand response or load management).
31 | We allow all segments of voluntary demand curtailment, $s \geq 2 \in S$,
32 | to contribute to capacity requirements.
33 | The first segment $s = 1 \in S$ corresponds to involuntary demand curtailment or
34 | emergency load shedding at the price cap or value of lost demand, and thus does not contribute to reserve requirements.
35 | Note that the time step-weighted sum of the shadow prices of this constraint corresponds
36 | to the capacity market payments reported by ISOs with mandate capacity market mechanism.

  3 | 
  4 | This policy constraints mimics the CO$_2$ emissions cap and permit trading systems,
  5 | allowing for emissions trading across each zone for which the cap applies.
  6 | The constraint $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}$ can be flexibly defined for mass-based or rate-based emission limits for one or more model zones,
  7 | where zones can trade CO$_2$ emissions permits and earn revenue based on their CO$_2$ allowance.
  8 | Note that if the model is fully linear (e.g. no unit commitment or linearized unit commitment),
  9 | the dual variable of the emissions constraints can be interpreted as the marginal CO$_2$ price per tonne associated with the emissions target.
 10 | Alternatively, for integer model formulations, the marginal CO$_2$ price can be obtained after solving the model with fixed integer/binary variables.
 11 | 
 12 | The CO$_2$ emissions limit can be defined in one of the following ways:
 13 | a) a mass-based limit defined in terms of annual CO$_2$ emissions budget (in million tonnes of CO2),
 14 | b) a demand-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO$_2$ per MWh of fulfilled demand and
 15 | c) a generation-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO$_2$ per MWh of generation.
 16 | 
 17 | **Mass-based emissions constraint**
 18 | 
 19 | Mass-based emission limits are implemented in the following expression.
 20 | For each constraint, $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{mass}$, we define a set of zones $z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}$ that can trade CO$_2$ allowance.
 21 | Input data for each constraint  $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{mass}$ requires the CO$_2$ allowance/ budget for each model zone,
 22 | $\epsilon^{CO_{2}}_{z,p, mass}$, to be provided in terms of million metric tonnes.
 23 | For every generator $y$, the parameter $\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2}$ reflects the specific $CO_2$ emission intensity in tCO$_2$/MWh associated with its operation.
 24 | The resulting constraint is given as:
 25 | 
 26 | ```math
 27 | \begin{aligned}
 28 |     \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left(\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,z,t} \right)
 29 |    & \leq \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}} \epsilon^{CO_{2}}_{z,p, mass} \hspace{1 cm}  \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{mass}
 30 | \end{aligned}
 31 | ```
 32 | 
 33 | In the above constraint, we include both power discharge and charge term for each resource to account for the potential for CO$_2$ emissions (or removal when considering negative emissions technologies) associated with each step.
 34 | Note that if a limit is applied to each zone separately, then the set $\mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}$ will contain only one zone with no possibility of trading.
 35 | If a system-wide emission limit constraint is applied, then $\mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,mass}$ will be equivalent to a set of all zones.
 36 | 
 37 | **Demand-side rate-based emissions constraint**
 38 | 
 39 | We modify the right hand side of the above mass-based constraint, $p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{demand}$,
 40 | to set emissions target based on a CO$_2$ emission rate limit in tCO$_2$/MWh $\times$ the total demand served (fulfilled) in each zone.
 41 | In the following constraint, total demand served takes into account non-served energy and storage related losses.
 42 | Here, $\epsilon_{z,p,demand}^{maxCO_2}$ denotes the emission limit in terms on tCO$_2$/MWh.
 43 | 
 44 | ```math
 45 | \begin{aligned}
 46 |     \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,demand}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left(\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,t,z} \right)
 47 |     \leq & \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,demand}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}}
 48 |     \left(\epsilon_{z,p,demand}^{CO_2} \times  \omega_{t} \times D_{z,t} \right) \\
 49 |     + & \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,demand}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{O} \cup \mathcal{VS}^{stor}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}}
 50 |     \left(\epsilon_{z,p,demand}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \left(\Pi_{y,t,z} - \Theta_{y,t,z} \right) \right) \\
 51 |     - & \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,demand}} \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S} } \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}}  \left(\epsilon_{z,p,demand}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Lambda_{s,z,t}\right) \hspace{1 cm}  \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{demand}
 52 | \end{aligned}
 53 | ```
 54 | 
 55 | **Generator-side emissions rate-based constraint**
 56 | 
 57 | Similarly, a generation based emission constraint is defined by setting the emission limit based on the total generation times the carbon emission rate limit in tCO$_2$/MWh of the region. The resulting constraint is given as:
 58 | 
 59 | ```math
 60 | \begin{aligned}
 61 | \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,gen}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} & \left(\epsilon_{y,z}^{CO_2} \times \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,t,z} \right) \\
 62 |     \leq \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{CO_2}_{p,gen}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} & \left(\epsilon_{z,p,gen}^{CO_2} \times  \omega_{t} \times \Theta_{y,t,z} \right)  \hspace{1 cm}  \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^{CO_2}_{gen}
 63 | \end{aligned}
 64 | ```
 65 | 
 66 | Note that the generator-side rate-based constraint can be used to represent a fee-rebate (``feebate'') system: the dirty generators that emit above the bar ($\epsilon_{z,p,gen}^{maxCO_2}$) have to buy emission allowances from the emission regulator in the region $z$ where they are located; in the same vein, the clean generators get rebates from the emission regulator at an emission allowance price being the dual variable of the emissions rate constraint.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2 | 	energy_share_requirement!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
 3 | This function establishes constraints that can be flexibily applied to define alternative forms of policies that require generation of a minimum quantity of megawatt-hours from a set of qualifying resources, such as renewable portfolio standard (RPS) or clean electricity standard (CES) policies prevalent in different jurisdictions.
 4 | These policies usually require that the annual MWh generation from a subset of qualifying generators has to be higher than a pre-specified percentage of demand from qualifying zones.
 5 | The implementation allows for user to define one or multiple RPS/CES style minimum energy share constraints,
 6 | where each constraint can cover different combination of model zones to mimic real-world policy implementation (e.g. multiple state policies, multiple RPS tiers or overlapping RPS and CES policies).
 7 | Including an energy share requirement constraint is specified by the user by the value of the GenX settings parameter ```EnergyShareRequirement``` (this value should either 0 or 1).
 8 | For each constraint $p \in \mathcal{P}^{ESR}$, we define a subset of zones $z \in \mathcal{Z}^{ESR}_{p} \subset \mathcal{Z}$ that are eligible for trading renewable/clean energy credits to meet the corresponding renewable/clean energy requirement.
 9 | For each energy share requirement constraint $p \in \mathcal{P}^{ESR}$,
10 | we specify the share of total demand in each eligible model zone,
11 | $z \in \mathcal{Z}^{ESR}_{p}$, that must be served by qualifying resources,
12 | $\mathcal{G}_{p}^{ESR} \subset \mathcal{G}$:
13 | ```math
14 | \begin{aligned}
15 | &\sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}_{p}^{ESR}} \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G}_{p}^{ESR}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} (\omega_{t} \times  \Theta_{y,z,t}) \geq  \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{ESR}_{p}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} (\mu_{p,z}^{ESR} \times \omega_{t} \times D_{z,t}) + \\
16 | &\sum_{y \in \mathcal{VS}^{stor}} \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}^{ESR}_{p}} \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \left(\mu_{p,z}^{ESR} \times \omega_{t} \times (\frac{\Pi^{dc}_{y,z,t}}{\eta_{y,z}^{inverter}} + \Pi^{ac}_{y,z,t} - \eta_{y,z}^{inverter} \times \Theta^{dc}_{y,z,t} - \Theta^{ac}_{y,z,t}) \right) + \\

18 | \end{aligned}
19 | ```
20 | The final two terms in the summation above adds roundtrip storage losses to the total demand to which the energy share obligation applies.
21 | This term is included in the constraint if the GenX setup parameter ```StorageLosses=1```.
22 | If ```StorageLosses=0```, this term is removed from the constraint.
23 | In practice, most existing renewable portfolio standard policies do not account for storage losses when determining energy share requirements.
24 | However, with 100% RPS or CES policies enacted in several jurisdictions, policy makers may wish to include storage losses in the minimum energy share, as otherwise there will be a difference between total generation and total demand that will permit continued use of non-qualifying resources (e.g. emitting generators).

 2 | 	minimum_capacity_requirement!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
 3 | The minimum capacity requirement constraint allows for modeling minimum deployment of a certain technology or set of eligible technologies across the eligible model zones and can be used to mimic policies supporting specific technology build out (i.e. capacity deployment targets/mandates for storage, offshore wind, solar etc.). The default unit of the constraint is in MW. For each requirement $p \in \mathcal{P}^{MinCapReq}$, we model the policy with the following constraint.
 4 | ```math
 5 | \begin{aligned}
 6 | \sum_{y \in \mathcal{G} } \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z} } \left( \epsilon_{y,z,p}^{MinCapReq} \times \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z} \right) \geq REQ_{p}^{MinCapReq} \hspace{1 cm}  \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^{MinCapReq}
 7 | \end{aligned}
 8 | ```
 9 | Note that $\epsilon_{y,z,p}^{MinCapReq}$ is the eligiblity of a generator of technology $y$ in zone $z$ of requirement $p$ and will be equal to $1$ for eligible generators and will be zero for ineligible resources. The dual value of each minimum capacity constraint can be interpreted as the required payment (e.g. subsidy) per MW per year required to ensure adequate revenue for the qualifying resources.
10 | 
11 | Also note that co-located VRE and storage resources, there are three different components 
12 | 	that minimum capacity requirements can be created for. The capacity of solar PV (in AC terms 
13 | 	since the capacity is multiplied by the inverter efficiency), the capacity of wind, and the discharge 
14 | 	capacity of storage (power to energy ratio times the energy capacity) can all have minimum capacity 
15 | 	requirements.

  2 | 	curtailable_variable_renewable!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | This function defines the constraints for operation of variable renewable energy (VRE) resources whose output can be curtailed (``y \in \mathcal{VRE}``), such as utility-scale solar PV or wind power resources or run-of-river hydro resources that can spill water.
  4 | The operational constraints for VRE resources are a function of each technology's time-dependent hourly capacity factor (or availability factor, ``\rho^{max}_{y,z,t}``), in per unit terms, and the total available capacity (``\Delta^{total}_{y,z}``).
  5 | 
  6 | **Power output in each time step**
  7 | For each VRE technology type ``y`` and model zone ``z``, the model allows for incorporating multiple bins with different parameters for resource quality (``\rho^{max}_{y,z,t}``), maximum availability (``\overline{\Omega_{y,z}}``) and investment cost (``\Pi^{INVEST}_{y,z}``, for example, due to interconnection cost differences). We define variables related to installed capacity (``\Delta_{y,z}``) and retired capacity (``\Delta_{y,z}``) for all resource bins for a particular VRE resource type ``y`` and zone ``z`` (``\overline{\mathcal{VRE}}^{y,z}``). However, the variable corresponding to power output in each timestep is only defined for the first bin. Parameter ``VREIndex_{y,z}``, is used to keep track of the first bin, where ``VREIndex_{y,z}=1`` for the first bin and ``VREIndex_{y,z}=0`` for the remaining bins. This approach allows for modeling many different bins per VRE technology type and zone while significantly reducing the number of operational variable (related to power output for each time step from each bin) added to the model with every additional bin. Thus, the maximum power output for each VRE resource type in each zone is given by the following equation:
  8 | ```math
  9 | \begin{aligned}
 10 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t} \leq \sum_{(x,z)\in \overline{\mathcal{VRE}}^{x,z}}{\rho^{max}_{x,z,t} \times \Delta^{total}_{x,z}}  \hspace{2 cm}  \forall y,z \in \{(y,z)|VREIndex_{y,z}=1, z \in \mathcal{Z}\},t \in \mathcal{T}
 11 | \end{aligned}
 12 | ```
 13 | The above constraint is defined as an inequality instead of an equality to allow for VRE power output to be curtailed if desired. This adds the possibility of introducing VRE curtailment as an extra degree of freedom to guarantee that generation exactly meets demand in each time step.
 14 | Note that if ```OperationalReserves=1``` indicating that frequency regulation and operating reserves are modeled, then this function calls ```curtailable_variable_renewable_operational_reserves!()```, which replaces the above constraints with a formulation inclusive of reserve provision.

 90 | ```math
 91 | \begin{aligned}
 92 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t} + f_{y,z,t} + r_{y,z,t} \leq \sum_{(x,z)\in \overline{\mathcal{VRE}}^{x,z}}{\rho^{max}_{x,z,t}\times \Delta^{total}_{x,z}}  \hspace{0.1 cm}   \forall y,z \in \{(y,z)|VREIndex_{y,z}=1, z \in \mathcal{Z}\},t \in \mathcal{T}

 94 | ```
 95 | The amount of downward frequency regulation reserves also cannot exceed the current power output.
 96 | ```math
 97 | \begin{aligned}
 98 | 	f_{y,z,t} \leq \Theta_{y,z,t}

102 | The amount of frequency regulation and operating reserves procured in each time step is bounded by the user-specified fraction ($\upsilon^{reg}_{y,z}$,$\upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z}$) of available capacity in each period for each reserve type, reflecting the maximum ramp rate for the VRE resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 | @doc raw"""
  2 |     flexible_demand!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | This function defines the operating constraints for flexible demand resources. As implemented, flexible demand resources (``y \in \mathcal{DF}``) are characterized by: a) maximum deferrable demand as a fraction of available capacity in a particular time step $t$, $\rho^{max}_{y,z,t}$, b) the maximum time this demand can be advanced and delayed, defined by parameters, $\tau^{advance}_{y,z}$ and $\tau^{delay}_{y,z}$, respectively and c) the energy losses associated with shifting demand, $\eta_{y,z}^{dflex}$.
  4 | 
  5 | **Tracking total deferred demand**
  6 | The operational constraints governing flexible demand resources are as follows.
  7 | The first two constraints model keep track of inventory of deferred demand in each time step.  Specifically, the amount of deferred demand remaining to be served ($\Gamma_{y,z,t}$) depends on the amount in the previous time step minus the served demand during time step $t$ ($\Theta_{y,z,t}$) while accounting for energy losses associated with demand flexibility, plus the demand that has been deferred during the current time step ($\Pi_{y,z,t}$). Note that variable $\Gamma_{y,z,t} \in \mathbb{R}$, $\forall y \in \mathcal{DF}, t  \in \mathcal{T}$. Similar to hydro inventory or storage state of charge constraints, for the first time step of the year (or each representative period), we define the deferred demand level based on level of deferred demand in the last time step of the year (or each representative period).
  8 | ```math
  9 | \begin{aligned}
 10 | \Gamma_{y,z,t} = \Gamma_{y,z,t-1} -\eta_{y,z}^{dflex}\Theta_{y,z,t} +\Pi_{y,z,t} \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{DF}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{interior} \\
 11 | \Gamma_{y,z,t} = \Gamma_{y,z,t +\tau^{period}-1} -\eta_{y,z}^{dflex}\Theta_{y,z,t} +\Pi_{y,z,t} \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{DF}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{start}
 12 | \end{aligned}
 13 | ```
 14 | **Bounds on available demand flexibility**
 15 | At any given time step, the amount of demand that can be shifted or deferred cannot exceed the maximum deferrable demand, defined by product of the availability factor ($\rho^{max}_{y,t}$) times the available capacity($\Delta^{total}_{y,z}$).
 16 | ```math
 17 | \begin{aligned}
 18 | \Pi_{y,t} \leq \rho^{max}_{y,z,t}\Delta_{y,z} \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{DF}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 19 | \end{aligned}
 20 | ```
 21 | At any given time step, the amount of demand that can be met cannot exceed the capacity of the FLEX resources.
 22 | ```math
 23 | \begin{aligned}
 24 | \eta_{y,z}^{dflex}\Theta_{y,z,t} \leq \Delta_{y,z} \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{DF}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 25 | \end{aligned}
 26 | ```
 27 | **Maximum time delay and advancements**
 28 | Delayed demand must then be served within a fixed number of time steps. This is done by enforcing the sum of demand satisfied ($\Theta_{y,z,t}$) in the following $\tau^{delay}_{y,z}$ time steps (e.g., t + 1 to t + $\tau^{delay}_{y,z}$) to be greater than or equal to the level of energy deferred during time step $t$.
 29 | ```math
 30 | \begin{aligned}
 31 | \sum_{e=t+1}^{t+\tau^{delay}_{y,z}}{\Theta_{y,z,e}} \geq \Gamma_{y,z,t}
 32 |     \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{DF},z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 33 | \end{aligned}
 34 | ```
 35 | A similar constraints maximum time steps of demand advancement. This is done by enforcing the sum of demand deferred ($\Pi_{y,t}$) in the following $\tau^{advance}_{y}$ time steps (e.g., t + 1 to t + $\tau^{advance}_{y}$) to be greater than or equal to the total level of energy deferred during time $t$ (-$\Gamma_{y,t}$). The negative sign is included to account for the established sign convention that treat demand deferred in advance of the actual demand is defined to be negative.
 36 | ```math
 37 | \begin{aligned}
 38 | \sum_{e=t+1}^{t+\tau^{advance}_{y,z}}{\Pi_{y,z,e}} \geq -\Gamma_{y,z,t}
 39 |     \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{DF}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 40 | \end{aligned}
 41 | ```
 42 | If $t$ is first time step of the year (or the first time step of the representative period), then the above two constraints are implemented to look back over the last n time steps, starting with the last time step of the year (or the last time step of the representative period). This time-wrapping implementation is similar to the time-wrapping implementations used for defining the storage balance constraints for hydropower reservoir resources and energy storage resources.

  2 | 	hydro_inter_period_linkage!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | This function creates variables and constraints enabling modeling of long duration storage resources when modeling representative time periods.
  4 | 
  5 | **Storage inventory balance at beginning of each representative period**
  6 | The constraints in this section are used to approximate the behavior of long-duration energy storage technologies when approximating annual grid operations by modeling operations over representative periods. Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in ```storage_all()```) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology $o$ in zone $z$ over the representative period $m$, $\Delta Q_{o,z,m} = 0$. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period $m$ ($\Delta Q_{o,z,m}$), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).
  7 | ```math
  8 | \begin{aligned}
  9 | & \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1 } =\left(1-\eta_{o,z}^{loss}\right)\times \left(\Gamma_{o,z,m\times \tau^{period}} -\Delta Q_{o,z,m}\right) -  \\
 10 | & \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, m \in \mathcal{M}
 11 | \end{aligned}
 12 | ```
 13 | By definition $\mathcal{T}^{start}=\{\left(m-1\right) \times \tau^{period}+1 | m \in \mathcal{M}\}$, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of $t \in T^{start}$.
 14 | 
 15 | **Storage inventory change input periods**
 16 | We need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable $Q_{o,z, n}$ that models inventory of storage technology $o \in O$ in zone $z$ in each input period $n \in \mathcal{N}$. Additionally we define a function mapping, $f: n \rightarrow m$, that uniquely maps each input period $n$ to its corresponding representative period $m$. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering [Mallapragada et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544218315238?casa_token=I-6GVNMtAVIAAAAA:G8LFXFqXxRGrXHtrzmiIGm02BusIUmm83zKh8xf1BXY81-dTnA9p2YI1NnGuzlYBXsxK12by)).
 17 | ![Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations](../../assets/LDES_approach.png)
 18 | *Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations*
 19 | The following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period $n+1$ as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period $n$ plus change in storage inventory for that period. The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping $f(n)$.  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, $|N|$, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period. Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints. Note that $|N|$ refers to the last modeled period.
 20 | ```math
 21 | \begin{aligned}
 22 | & Q_{o,z,n+1} = Q_{o,z,n} + \Delta Q_{o,z,f(n)}
 23 | \quad \forall  o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in \mathcal{N}\setminus\{|N|\}
 24 | \end{aligned}
 25 | ```
 26 | ```math
 27 | \begin{aligned}
 28 | & Q_{o,z,1} = Q_{o,z,|N|} + \Delta Q_{o,z,f(|N|)}
 29 | \quad \forall  o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n = |N|
 30 | \end{aligned}
 31 | ```
 32 | ```math
 33 | \begin{aligned}
 34 | & Q_{o,z,n} =\Gamma_{o,z,f(n)\times \tau^{period}} - \Delta Q_{o,z,m}
 35 | \quad \forall  o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in   \mathcal{N}^{rep},
 36 | \end{aligned}
 37 | ```
 38 | Finally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period $n$ must be less than the installed energy capacity limit. This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods $t$ during each sample period $m$ as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period $n$ in the full annual time series.
 39 | ```math
 40 | \begin{aligned}
 41 |     Q_{o,z,n} \leq \Delta^{total, energy}_{o,z}
 42 | \quad \forall n \in \mathcal{N}, o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}
 43 | \end{aligned}
 44 | ```
 45 | 
 46 | **Bound storage inventory in non-representative periods**
 47 | We need additional variables and constraints to ensure that the storage content is within zero and the installed energy capacity in non-representative periods. We introduce
 48 | the variables $\Delta Q^{max,pos}_{o,z,m}$ and $\Delta Q^{max,neg}_{o,z,m}$ that represent the maximum positive and negative storage content variations within the representative
 49 | period $m$, respectively, extracted as:
 50 | 
 51 | ```math
 52 | \begin{aligned}
 53 | & \Delta Q^{max,pos}_{o,z,m} \geq \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+t } - \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1 } \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, m \in \mathcal{M}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 54 | & \end{aligned}
 55 | ```

 58 | \begin{aligned}
 59 | & \Delta Q^{max,neg}_{o,z,m} \leq \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+t } - \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1 } \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, m \in \mathcal{M}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 60 | & \end{aligned}

 62 | 
 63 | For every input period $n \in \mathcal{N}$, the maximum storage is computed and constrained to be less than or equal to the installed energy capacity as:
 64 | 
 65 | ```math
 66 | \begin{aligned}
 67 | &  Q_{o,z,n} \times \left(1-\eta_{o,z}^{loss}\right) - \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \Delta Q^{max,pos}_{o,z,f(n)} \leq \Delta^{total, energy}_{o,z} \\
 68 | & \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in \mathcal{N}
 69 | & \end{aligned}
 70 | ```
 71 | 
 72 | Similarly, the minimum storage content is imposed to be positive in every period of the time horizon:
 73 | 
 74 | ```math
 75 | \begin{aligned}
 76 | &  Q_{o,z,n} \times \left(1-\eta_{o,z}^{loss}\right) - \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \Delta Q^{max,neg}_{o,z,f(n)} \geq 0 \\
 77 | & \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in \mathcal{N}

  3 | This module defines the operational constraints for reservoir hydropower plants.
  4 | Hydroelectric generators with water storage reservoirs ($y \in \mathcal{W}$) are effectively modeled as energy storage devices that cannot charge from the grid and instead receive exogenous inflows to their storage reservoirs, reflecting stream flow inputs. For resources with unknown reservoir capacity ($y \in \mathcal{W}^{nocap}$), their operation is parametrized by their generation efficiency, $\eta_{y,z}^{down}$, and energy inflows to the reservoir at every time-step, represented as a fraction of the total power capacity,($\rho^{max}_{y,z,t}$).  In case reservoir capacity is known ($y \in \mathcal{W}^{cap}$), an additional parameter, $\mu^{stor}_{y,z}$, referring to the ratio of energy capacity to discharge power capacity, is used to define the available reservoir storage capacity.
  5 | 
  6 | **Storage inventory balance**
  7 | Reservoir hydro systems are governed by the storage inventory balance constraint given below. This constraint enforces that energy level of the reservoir resource $y$ and zone $z$ in time step $t$ ($\Gamma_{y,z,t}$) is defined as the sum of the reservoir level in the previous time step, less the amount of electricity generated, $\Theta_{y,z,t}$ (accounting for the generation efficiency, $\eta_{y,z}^{down}$), minus any spillage $\varrho_{y,z,t}$, plus the hourly inflows into the reservoir (equal to the installed reservoir discharged capacity times the normalized hourly inflow parameter $\rho^{max}_{y,z, t}$).
  8 | ```math
  9 | \begin{aligned}
 10 | &\Gamma_{y,z,t} = \Gamma_{y,z,t-1} -\frac{1}{\eta_{y,z}^{down}}\Theta_{y,z,t} - \varrho_{y,z,t} + \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}  \hspace{.1 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{interior} \\
 11 | &\Gamma_{y,z,t} = \Gamma_{y,z,t+\tau^{period}-1} -\frac{1}{\eta_{y,z}^{down}}\Theta_{y,z,t} - \varrho_{y,z,t} + \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}  \hspace{.1 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{start}
 12 | \end{aligned}
 13 | ```
 14 | We implement time-wrapping to endogenize the definition of the intial state prior to the first period with the following assumption. If time step $t$ is the first time step of the year then storage inventory at $t$ is defined based on last time step of the year. Alternatively, if time step $t$ is the first time step of a representative period, then storage inventory at $t$ is defined based on the last time step of the representative period. Thus, when using representative periods, the storage balance constraint for hydro resources does not allow for energy exchange between representative periods.
 15 | Note: in future updates, an option to model hydro resources with large reservoirs that can transfer energy across sample periods will be implemented, similar to the functions for modeling long duration energy storage in ```long_duration_storage.jl```.
 16 | 
 17 | **Ramping Limits**
 18 | The following constraints enforce hourly changes in power output (ramps down and ramps up) to be less than the maximum ramp rates ($\kappa^{down}_{y,z}$ and $\kappa^{up}_{y,z}$ ) in per unit terms times the total installed capacity of technology y ($\Delta^{total}_{y,z}$).
 19 | ```math
 20 | \begin{aligned}
 21 | &\Theta_{y,z,t} + f_{y,z,t} + r_{y,z,t} - \Theta_{y,z,t-1} - f_{y,z,t-1} \leq \kappa^{up}_{y,z} \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
 22 | \hspace{2 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 23 | \end{aligned}
 24 | ```
 25 | ```math
 26 | \begin{aligned}
 27 | &\Theta_{y,z,t-1} + f_{y,z,t-1}  + r_{y,z,t-1} - \Theta_{y,z,t} - f_{y,z,t}\leq \kappa^{down}_{y,z} \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
 28 | \hspace{2 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 29 | \end{aligned}
 30 | ```
 31 | Ramping constraints are enforced for all time steps except the first time step of the year or first time of each representative period when using representative periods to model grid operations.
 32 | 
 33 | **Power generation and stream flow bounds**
 34 | Electricity production plus total spilled power from hydro resources is constrained to always be above a minimum output parameter, $\rho^{min}_{y,z}$, to represent operational constraints related to minimum stream flows or other demands for water from hydro reservoirs. Electricity production is constrained by either the the net installed capacity or by the energy level in the reservoir in the prior time step, whichever is more binding. For the latter constraint, the constraint for the first time step of the year (or the first time step of each representative period) is implemented based on energy storage level in last time step of the year (or last time step of each representative period).
 35 | ```math
 36 | \begin{aligned}
 37 | &\Theta_{y,z,t} + \varrho_{y,z,t}  \geq \rho^{min}_{y,z} \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
 38 | \hspace{2 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 39 | \end{aligned}
 40 | ```
 41 | ```math
 42 | \begin{aligned}
 43 | \Theta_{y,t}  \leq \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
 44 | \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t\in \mathcal{T}
 45 | \end{aligned}
 46 | ```
 47 | ```math
 48 | \begin{aligned}
 49 | \Theta_{y,z,t} \leq  \Gamma_{y,t-1}
 50 | \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t\in \mathcal{T}
 51 | \end{aligned}
 52 | ```
 53 | 
 54 | **Reservoir energy capacity constraint**
 55 | In case the reservoir capacity is known ($y \in W^{cap}$), then an additional constraint enforces the total stored energy in each time step to be less than or equal to the available reservoir capacity. Here, the reservoir capacity is defined multiplying the parameter, $\mu^{stor}_{y,z}$ with the available power capacity.
 56 | ```math
 57 | \begin{aligned}
 58 | \Gamma_{y,z, t} \leq \mu^{stor}_{y,z}\times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
 59 | \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}^{cap}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t\in \mathcal{T}

187 | This module defines the modified constraints and additional constraints needed when modeling operating reserves
188 | 
189 | **Modifications when operating reserves are modeled**
190 | When modeling operating reserves, the constraints regarding maximum power flow limits are modified to account for procuring some of the available capacity for frequency regulation ($f_{y,z,t}$) and "updward" operating (or spinning) reserves ($r_{y,z,t}$).
191 | ```math
192 | \begin{aligned}
193 |  \Theta_{y,z,t} + f_{y,z,t} +r_{y,z,t}  \leq  \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
194 | \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t\in \mathcal{T}
195 | \end{aligned}
196 | ```
197 | The amount of downward frequency regulation reserves cannot exceed the current power output.
198 | ```math
199 | \begin{aligned}
200 |  f_{y,z,t} \leq \Theta_{y,z,t}
201 | \hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
202 | \end{aligned}
203 | ```
204 | The amount of frequency regulation and operating reserves procured in each time step is bounded by the user-specified fraction ($\upsilon^{reg}_{y,z}$,$\upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z}$) of nameplate capacity for each reserve type, reflecting the maximum ramp rate for the hydro resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.
205 | ```math
206 | \begin{aligned}
207 | f_{y,z,t} \leq \upsilon^{reg}_{y,z} \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}

  2 | 	electrolyzer!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | 
  4 | This function defines the expressions and constraints for operation of hydrogen electrolyzers ($y \in \mathcal{EL} \subseteq \mathcal{G}$).
  5 | 	This is a basic implementation of hydrogen electrolyzers that allows the specification of an hourly clean supply constraint.
  6 | 	For a richer formulation, please see the DOLPHYN code at https://github.com/macroenergy/DOLPHYN.
  7 | 
  8 | **Expressions**
  9 | 
 10 | Consumption of electricity by electrolyzer $y$ in time $t$, denoted by $\Pi_{y,z}$, is subtracted from power balance expression `ePowerBalance` (as per other demands or battery charging) and added to Energy Share Requirement policy balance (if applicable), `eESR`.
 11 | 
 12 | Revenue from hydrogen production by each electrolyzer $y$, equal to `` \omega_t \times \Pi_{y,t} / \eta^{electrolyzer}_y \times \$^{hydrogen}_y ``, is subtracted from the objective function, where $\eta^{electrolyzer}_y$ is the efficiency of the electrolyzer $y$ in megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity per metric tonne of hydrogen produced and ``\$^{hydrogen}_y`` is the price of hydrogen per metric tonne for electrolyzer $y$.
 13 | 
 14 | Hourly consumption from electrolyzers $y$ in the zone, equal to:
 15 | ```math
 16 | \begin{aligned}
 17 |     \sum_{y \in {z \cap \mathcal{EL}}} \Pi_{y,t}
 18 | \end{aligned}
 19 | ```
 20 | is subtracted from the hourly matching policy balance `eHM` (if applicable).
 21 | 
 22 | **Ramping limits**
 23 | 
 24 | Electrolyzers adhere to the following ramping limits on hourly changes in power output:
 25 | 
 26 | ```math
 27 | \begin{aligned}
 28 | 	\Pi_{y,t-1} - \Pi_{y,t} \leq \kappa_{y}^{down} \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y}, \hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{EL}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 29 | \end{aligned}
 30 | ```
 31 | 
 32 | ```math
 33 | \begin{aligned}
 34 | 	\Pi_{y,t} - \Pi_{y,t-1} \leq \kappa_{y}^{up} \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y} \hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{EL}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 35 | \end{aligned}
 36 | ```
 37 | (See Constraints 1-2 in the code)
 38 | 
 39 | This set of time-coupling constraints wrap around to ensure the power output in the first time step of each year (or each representative period), $t \in \mathcal{T}^{start}$, is within the eligible ramp of the power output in the final time step of the year (or each representative period), $t+\tau^{period}-1$.
 40 | 
 41 | **Minimum and maximum power output**
 42 | 
 43 | Electrolyzers are bound by the following limits on maximum and minimum power output:
 44 | 
 45 | ```math
 46 | \begin{aligned}
 47 | 	\Pi_{y,t} \geq \rho^{min}_{y} \times \Delta^{total}_{y}
 48 | 	\hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{EL}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 49 | \end{aligned}
 50 | ```
 51 | 
 52 | ```math
 53 | \begin{aligned}
 54 | 	\Theta_{y,t} \leq \rho^{max}_{y} \times \Pi^{total}_{y}
 55 | 	\hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{EL}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}

  2 | 	long_duration_storage!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | This function creates variables and constraints enabling modeling of long duration storage resources when modeling representative time periods.\
  4 | 
  5 | **Storage inventory balance at beginning of each representative period**
  6 | The constraints in this section are used to approximate the behavior of long-duration energy storage technologies when approximating annual grid operations by modeling operations over representative periods. Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in ```storage_all()```) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology $o$ in zone $z$ over the representative period $m$, $\Delta Q_{o,z,m} = 0$. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period $m$ ($\Delta Q_{o,z,m}$), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).
  7 | 
  8 | ```math
  9 | \begin{aligned}
 10 | & \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1 } =\left(1-\eta_{o,z}^{loss}\right)\times \left(\Gamma_{o,z,m\times \tau^{period}} -\Delta Q_{o,z,m}\right) -  \\
 11 | & \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, m \in \mathcal{M}
 12 | \end{aligned}
 13 | ```
 14 | By definition $\mathcal{T}^{start}=\{\left(m-1\right) \times \tau^{period}+1 | m \in \mathcal{M}\}$, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of $t \in T^{start}$. \
 15 | **Storage inventory change input periods**
 16 | We need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable $Q_{o,z, n}$ that models inventory of storage technology $o \in O$ in zone $z$ in each input period $n \in \mathcal{N}$. Additionally we define a function mapping, $f: n \rightarrow m$, that uniquely maps each input period $n$ to its corresponding representative period $m$. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering [Mallapragada et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544218315238?casa_token=I-6GVNMtAVIAAAAA:G8LFXFqXxRGrXHtrzmiIGm02BusIUmm83zKh8xf1BXY81-dTnA9p2YI1NnGuzlYBXsxK12by)).

 19 | *Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations*
 20 | 
 21 | The following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period $n+1$ as
 22 | the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period $n$ plus change in storage inventory for that period.
 23 | The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period,
 24 | identified per the mapping $f(n)$.
 25 | If the input period is also a representative period,
 26 | then a second constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints.
 27 | 
 28 | ```math
 29 | \begin{aligned}
 30 | & Q_{o,z,n+1} = Q_{o,z,n} + \Delta Q_{o,z,f(n)}
 31 | \quad \forall  o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in \mathcal{N}
 32 | \end{aligned}
 33 | ```
 34 | 
 35 | ```math
 36 | \begin{aligned}
 37 | & Q_{o,z,n} =\Gamma_{o,z,f(n)\times \tau^{period}} - \Delta Q_{o,z,m}
 38 | \quad \forall  o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in   \mathcal{N}^{rep},
 39 | \end{aligned}
 40 | ```
 41 | 
 42 | Finally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period $n$ must be less than the installed energy capacity limit. This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods $t$ during each sample period $m$ as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period $n$ in the full annual time series.
 43 | 
 44 | ```math
 45 | \begin{aligned}
 46 |     Q_{o,z,n} \leq \Delta^{total, energy}_{o,z}
 47 | \quad \forall n \in \mathcal{N}, o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}
 48 | \end{aligned}
 49 | ```
 50 | 
 51 | If the capacity reserve margin constraint is enabled, a similar set of constraints is used to track the evolution of the energy held in reserve across representative periods. The main linking constraint is as follows:
 52 | ```math
 53 | \begin{aligned}
 54 | & \Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1 } =\left(1-\eta_{o,z}^{loss}\right)\times \left(\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,m\times \tau^{period}} -\Delta Q_{o,z,m}\right) +  \\
 55 | & \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} - \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, m \in \mathcal{M}
 56 | \end{aligned}
 57 | ```
 58 | All other constraints are identical to those used to track the actual state of charge, except with the new variables $Q^{CRM}_{o,z,n}$ and $\Delta Q^{CRM}_{o,z,n}$ used in place of $Q_{o,z,n}$ and $\Delta Q_{o,z,n}$, respectively. \
 59 | 
 60 | **Bound storage inventory in non-representative periods**
 61 | We need additional variables and constraints to ensure that the storage content is within zero and the installed energy capacity in non-representative periods. We introduce
 62 | the variables $\Delta Q^{max,pos}_{o,z,m}$ and $\Delta Q^{max,neg}_{o,z,m}$ that represent the maximum positive and negative storage content variations within the representative
 63 | period $m$, respectively, extracted as:
 64 | 
 65 | ```math
 66 | \begin{aligned}
 67 | & \Delta Q^{max,pos}_{o,z,m} \geq \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+t } - \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1 } \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, m \in \mathcal{M}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 68 | & \end{aligned}
 69 | ```
 70 | 
 71 | ```math
 72 | \begin{aligned}
 73 | & \Delta Q^{max,neg}_{o,z,m} \leq \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+t } - \Gamma_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1 } \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, m \in \mathcal{M}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 74 | & \end{aligned}
 75 | ```
 76 | 
 77 | For every input period $n \in \mathcal{N}$, the maximum storage is computed and constrained to be less than or equal to the installed energy capacity as:
 78 | 
 79 | ```math
 80 | \begin{aligned}
 81 | &  Q_{o,z,n} \times \left(1-\eta_{o,z}^{loss}\right) - \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \Delta Q^{max,pos}_{o,z,f(n)} \leq \Delta^{total, energy}_{o,z} \\
 82 | & \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in \mathcal{N}
 83 | & \end{aligned}
 84 | ```
 85 | 
 86 | Similarly, the minimum storage content is imposed to be positive in every period of the time horizon:
 87 | 
 88 | ```math
 89 | \begin{aligned}
 90 | &  Q_{o,z,n} \times \left(1-\eta_{o,z}^{loss}\right) - \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,(m-1)\times \tau^{period}+1} + \Delta Q^{max,neg}_{o,z,f(n)} \geq 0 \\
 91 | & \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{LDES}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, n \in \mathcal{N}
 92 | & \end{aligned}
 93 | ```

  2 | 	storage!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | A wide range of energy storage devices (all $o \in \mathcal{O}$) can be modeled in GenX, using one of two generic storage formulations: (1) storage technologies with symmetric charge and discharge capacity (all $o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}$), such as Lithium-ion batteries and most other electrochemical storage devices that use the same components for both charge and discharge; and (2) storage technologies that employ distinct and potentially asymmetric charge and discharge capacities (all $o \in \mathcal{O}^{asym}$), such as most thermal storage technologies or hydrogen electrolysis/storage/fuel cell or combustion turbine systems.
  4 | 
  5 | If a capacity reserve margin is modeled, variables for virtual charge, $\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, and virtual discharge, $\Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, are created to represent 
  6 | 	contributions that a storage device makes to the capacity reserve margin without actually generating power. (This functionality can be turned off with the parameter StorageVirtualDischarge in the GenX settings file.) These represent power that the storage device could 
  7 | 	have discharged or consumed if called upon to do so, based on its available state of charge. Importantly, a dedicated set of variables (those of the form $\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t}, \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$) 
  8 | 	and constraints are created to ensure that any virtual contributions to the capacity reserve margin could be made as actual charge/discharge if necessary without 
  9 | 	affecting system operations in any other timesteps. If a capacity reserve margin is not modeled, all related variables are fixed at 0. The overall contribution 
 10 | 	of storage devices to the system's capacity reserve margin in timestep $t$ is equal to $\sum_{y \in \mathcal{O}} \epsilon_{y,z,p}^{CRM} \times \left(\Theta_{y,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} - \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} - \Pi_{y,z,t} \right)$, 
 11 | 	and includes both actual and virtual charge and discharge.
 12 | ```math
 13 | \begin{aligned}
 14 | 	&  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
 15 | 	&  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + \Theta_{o,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 16 | \end{aligned}
 17 | ```
 18 | 
 19 | **Storage with symmetric charge and discharge capacity**
 20 | For storage technologies with symmetric charge and discharge capacity (all $o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}$), charge rate, $\Pi_{o,z,t}$, and virtual charge rate, $\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, are jointly constrained by the total installed power capacity, $\Omega_{o,z}$. Since storage resources generally represent a `cluster' of multiple similar storage devices of the same type/cost in the same zone, GenX permits storage resources to simultaneously charge and discharge (as some units could be charging while others discharge), with the simultaenous sum of charge, $\Pi_{o,z,t}$, discharge, $\Theta_{o,z,t}$, virtual charge, $\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, and virtual discharge, $\Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, also limited by the total installed power capacity, $\Delta^{total}_{o,z}$. These two constraints are as follows:
 21 | ```math
 22 | \begin{aligned}
 23 | &  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
 24 | &  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + \Theta_{o,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 25 | \end{aligned}
 26 | ```
 27 | These constraints are created with the function ```storage_symmetric!()``` in ```storage_symmetric.jl```.
 28 | If reserves are modeled, the following two constraints replace those above:
 29 | ```math
 30 | \begin{aligned}
 31 | &  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + f^{charge}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
 32 | &  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + f^{charge}_{o,z,t} + \Theta_{o,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + f^{discharge}_{o,z,t} + r^{discharge}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{sym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T} \\
 33 | \end{aligned}
 34 | ```
 35 | where $f^{charge}_{o,z,t}$ is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while charging, $f^{discharge}_{o,z,t}$ is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while discharging, and $r^{discharge}_{o,z,t}$ is the contribution of storage resources to upward reserves while discharging. Note that as storage resources can contribute to regulation and reserves while either charging or discharging, the proxy variables $f^{charge}_{o,z,t}, f^{discharge}_{o,z,t}$ and $r^{charge}_{o,z,t}, r^{discharge}_{o,z,t}$ are created for storage resources where the total contribution to regulation and reserves, $f_{o,z,t}, r_{o,z,t}$ is the sum of the proxy variables.
 36 | These constraints are created with the function ```storage_symmetric_operational_reserves!()``` in ```storage_symmetric.jl```.
 37 | **Storage with asymmetric charge and discharge capacity**
 38 | For storage technologies with asymmetric charge and discharge capacities (all $o \in \mathcal{O}^{asym}$), charge rate, $\Pi_{o,z,t}$, is constrained by the total installed charge capacity, $\Delta^{total, charge}_{o,z}$, as follows:
 39 | ```math
 40 | \begin{aligned}
 41 | 	&  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total, charge}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{asym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 42 | \end{aligned}
 43 | ```
 44 | These constraints are created with the function ```storage_asymmetric()``` in ```storage_asymmetric.jl```.
 45 | If reserves are modeled, the above constraint is replaced by the following:
 46 | ```math
 47 | \begin{aligned}
 48 | 	&  \Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + f^{charge}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total, charge}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}^{asym}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 49 | \end{aligned}
 50 | ```
 51 | where $f^{+}_{y=o,z,t}$ is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while charging.
 52 | These constraints are created with the function ```storage_symmetric_operational_reserves!()``` in ```storage_asymmetric.jl```.
 53 | **All storage resources**
 54 | The following constraints apply to all storage resources, $o \in \mathcal{O}$, regardless of whether the charge/discharge capacities are symmetric or asymmetric.
 55 | The following two constraints track the state of charge of the storage resources at the end of each time period, relating the volume of energy stored at the end of the time period, $\Gamma_{o,z,t}$, to the state of charge at the end of the prior time period, $\Gamma_{o,z,t-1}$, the charge and discharge decisions in the current time period, $\Pi_{o,z,t}, \Theta_{o,z,t}$, and the self discharge rate for the storage resource (if any), $\eta_{o,z}^{loss}$.  The first of these two constraints enforces storage inventory balance for interior time steps $(t \in \mathcal{T}^{interior})$, while the second enforces storage balance constraint for the initial time step $(t \in \mathcal{T}^{start})$.
 56 | ```math
 57 | \begin{aligned}
 58 | 	&  \Gamma_{o,z,t} =\Gamma_{o,z,t-1} - \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,t} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,t} - \eta_{o,z}^{loss}\Gamma_{o,z,t-1}  \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{interior}\\
 59 | 	&  \Gamma_{o,z,t} =\Gamma_{o,z,t+\tau^{period}-1} - \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta_{o,z,t} + \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi_{o,z,t} - \eta_{o,z}^{loss}\Gamma_{o,z,t+\tau^{period}-1}  \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{start}
 60 | \end{aligned}
 61 | ```
 62 | If a capacity reserve margin is modeled, then the following constraints track the relationship between the virtual charge, $\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, and virtual discharge, $\Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, variables and a third variable, $\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, representing the amount of state of charge that must be held in reserve to enable these virtual capacity reserve margin contributions, ensuring that the storage device could deliver its pledged capacity if called upon to do so without affecting its operations in other timesteps. $\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$ is tracked similarly to the devices overall state of charge based on its value in the previous timestep and the virtual charge and discharge in the current timestep. Unlike the regular state of charge, virtual discharge $\Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$ increases $\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$ (as more charge must be held in reserve to support more virtual discharge), and $\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$ reduces $\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$.
 63 | ```math
 64 | \begin{aligned}
 65 | 	&  \Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t} =\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t-1} + \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} - \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} - \eta_{o,z}^{loss}\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t-1}  \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{interior}\\
 66 | 	&  \Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t} =\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t+\tau^{period}-1} + \frac{1}{\eta_{o,z}^{discharge}}\Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} - \eta_{o,z}^{charge}\Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} - \eta_{o,z}^{loss}\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t+\tau^{period}-1}  \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}^{start}
 67 | \end{aligned}
 68 | ```
 69 | The energy held in reserve, $\Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, also acts as a lower bound on the overall state of charge $\Gamma_{o,z,t}$. This ensures that the storage device cannot use state of charge that would not have been available had it been called on to actually contribute its pledged virtual discharge at some earlier timestep. This relationship is described by the following equation:
 70 | ```math
 71 | \begin{aligned}
 72 | 	&  \Gamma_{o,z,t} \geq \Gamma^{CRM}_{o,z,t} 
 73 | \end{aligned}
 74 | ```
 75 | 
 76 | When modeling the entire year as a single chronological period with total number of time steps of $\tau^{period}$, storage inventory in the first time step is linked to storage inventory at the last time step of the period representing the year.
 77 | Alternatively, when modeling the entire year with multiple representative periods, this constraint relates storage inventory in the first timestep of the representative period with the inventory at the last time step of the representative period, where each representative period is made of $\tau^{period}$ time steps.
 78 | In this implementation, energy exchange between representative periods is not permitted.
 79 | When modeling representative time periods, GenX enables modeling of long duration energy storage which tracks state of charge (and state of charge held in reserve, if a capacity reserve margin is being modeled) between representative periods enable energy to be moved throughout the year.
 80 | If there is more than one representative period and ```LDS``` has been enabled for resources in ```Generators.csv```, this function calls ```long_duration_storage()``` in ```long_duration_storage.jl``` to enable this feature.
 81 | The next constraint limits the volume of energy stored at any time, $\Gamma_{o,z,t}$, to be less than the installed energy storage capacity, $\Delta^{total, energy}_{o,z}$.
 82 | Finally, the maximum combined discharge and virtual discharge rate for storage resources, $\Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t}$, is constrained to be less than the discharge power capacity, $\Omega_{o,z,t}$ or the state of charge at the end of the last period, $\Gamma_{o,z,t-1}$, whichever is less.
 83 | ```math
 84 | \begin{aligned}
 85 | 	&  \Gamma_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total, energy}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
 86 | 	&  \Theta_{o,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
 87 | 	&  \Theta_{o,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} \leq \Gamma_{o,z,t-1} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 88 | \end{aligned}
 89 | ```
 90 | The above constraints are established in ```storage_all!()``` in ```storage_all.jl```.
 91 | If reserves are modeled, two pairs of proxy variables $f^{charge}_{o,z,t}, f^{discharge}_{o,z,t}$ and $r^{charge}_{o,z,t}, r^{discharge}_{o,z,t}$ are created for storage resources, to denote the contribution of storage resources to regulation or reserves while charging or discharging, respectively. The total contribution to regulation and reserves, $f_{o,z,t}, r_{o,z,t}$ is then the sum of the proxy variables:
 92 | ```math
 93 | \begin{aligned}
 94 | 	&  f_{o,z,t} = f^{charge}_{o,z,t} + f^{dicharge}_{o,z,t} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
 95 | 	&  r_{o,z,t} = r^{charge}_{o,z,t} + r^{dicharge}_{o,z,t} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
 96 | \end{aligned}
 97 | ```
 98 | The total storage contribution to frequency regulation ($f_{o,z,t}$) and reserves ($r_{o,z,t}$) are each limited specified fraction of installed discharge power capacity ($\upsilon^{reg}_{y,z}, \upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z}$), reflecting the maximum ramp rate for the storage resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.
 99 | ```math
100 | \begin{aligned}
101 | 	f_{y,z,t} \leq \upsilon^{reg}_{y,z} \times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
102 | 	\hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T} \\
103 | 	r_{y,z, t} \leq \upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z}\times \Delta^{total}_{y,z}
104 | 	\hspace{4 cm}  \forall y \in \mathcal{W}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
105 | 	\end{aligned}
106 | ```
107 | When charging, reducing the charge rate is contributing to upwards reserve and frequency regulation as it drops net demand. As such, the sum of the charge rate plus contribution to regulation and reserves up must be greater than zero. Additionally, the discharge rate plus the contribution to regulation must be greater than zero.
108 | ```math
109 | \begin{aligned}
110 | 	&  \Pi_{o,z,t} - f^{charge}_{o,z,t} - r^{charge}_{o,z,t} \geq 0 & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
111 | 	&  \Theta_{o,z,t} - f^{discharge}_{o,z,t} \geq 0 & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
112 | \end{aligned}
113 | ```
114 | Additionally, when reserves are modeled, the maximum charge rate, virtual charge rate,
115 | and contribution to regulation while charging can be no greater than the available energy storage capacity,
116 | or the difference between the total energy storage capacity, $\Delta^{total, energy}_{o,z}$, and the state of charge at the end of the previous time period, $\Gamma_{o,z,t-1}$, while accounting for charging losses $\eta_{o,z}^{charge}$. Note that for storage to contribute to reserves down while charging, the storage device must be capable of increasing the charge rate (which increase net load).
117 | ```math
118 | \begin{aligned}
119 | 	&  \eta_{o,z}^{charge} \times (\Pi_{o,z,t} + \Pi^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + f^{charge}_{o,z,t}) \leq \Delta^{energy, total}_{o,z} - \Gamma_{o,z,t-1} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
120 | \end{aligned}
121 | ```
122 | Finally, the constraints on maximum discharge rate are replaced by the following, to account for capacity contributed to regulation and reserves:
123 | ```math
124 | \begin{aligned}
125 | 	&  \Theta_{o,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + f^{discharge}_{o,z,t} + r^{discharge}_{o,z,t} \leq \Delta^{total}_{o,z} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}\\
126 | 	&  \Theta_{o,z,t} + \Theta^{CRM}_{o,z,t} + f^{discharge}_{o,z,t} + r^{discharge}_{o,z,t} \leq \Gamma_{o,z,t-1} & \quad \forall o \in \mathcal{O}, z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
127 | \end{aligned}
128 | ```
129 | The above reserve related constraints are established by ```storage_all_operational_reserves!()``` in ```storage_all.jl```

  2 | 	thermal_commit!(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)
  3 | 
  4 | This function defines the operating constraints for thermal power plants subject to unit commitment constraints on power plant start-ups and shut-down decision ($y \in UC$).
  5 | 
  6 | We model capacity investment decisions and commitment and cycling (start-up, shut-down) of thermal generators using the integer clustering technique developed in [Palmintier, 2011](https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/impact-of-unit-commitment-constraints-on-generation-expansion-pla), [Palmintier, 2013](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/79147), and [Palmintier, 2014](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6684593). In a typical binary unit commitment formulation, each unit is either on or off. With the clustered unit commitment formulation, one or more cluster(s) of similar generators are clustered by type and zone (typically using heat rate and fixed O\&M cost to create clusters), and the integer commitment state variable for each cluster varies from zero to the number of units in the cluster, $\frac{\Delta^{total}_{y,z}}{\Omega^{size}_{y,z}}$. As discussed in \cite{Palmintier2014}, this approach replaces the large set of binary commitment decisions and associated constraints, which scale directly with the number of individual units, with a smaller set of integer commitment states and  constraints, one for each cluster $y$. The dimensionality of the problem thus scales with the number of units of a given type in each zone, rather than by the number of discrete units, significantly improving computational efficiency. However, this method entails the simplifying assumption that all clustered units have identical parameters (e.g., capacity size, ramp rates, heat rate) and that all committed units in a given time step $t$ are operating at the same power output per unit.
  7 | 
  8 | **Power balance expression**
  9 | 
 10 | This function adds the sum of power generation from thermal units subject to unit commitment ($\Theta_{y \in UC,t \in T,z \in Z}$) to the power balance expression.
 11 | 
 12 | **Startup and shutdown events (thermal plant cycling)**
 13 | 
 14 | *Capacitated limits on unit commitment decision variables*
 15 | 
 16 | Thermal resources subject to unit commitment ($y \in \mathcal{UC}$) adhere to the following constraints on commitment states, startup events, and shutdown events, which limit each decision to be no greater than the maximum number of discrete units installed (as per the following three constraints):
 17 | 
 18 | ```math
 19 | \begin{aligned}
 20 | \nu_{y,z,t} \leq \frac{\Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z}}{\Omega^{size}_{y,z}}
 21 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 22 | \end{aligned}
 23 | ```
 24 | 
 25 | ```math
 26 | \begin{aligned}
 27 | \chi_{y,z,t} \leq \frac{\Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z}}{\Omega^{size}_{y,z}}
 28 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 29 | \end{aligned}
 30 | ```
 31 | 
 32 | ```math
 33 | \begin{aligned}
 34 | \zeta_{y,z,t} \leq \frac{\Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z}}{\Omega^{size}_{y,z}}
 35 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 36 | \end{aligned}
 37 | ```
 38 | (See Constraints 1-3 in the code)
 39 | 
 40 | where decision $\nu_{y,z,t}$ designates the commitment state of generator cluster $y$ in zone $z$ at time $t$, decision $\chi_{y,z,t}$ represents number of startup decisions, decision $\zeta_{y,z,t}$ represents number of shutdown decisions, $\Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z}$ is the total installed capacity, and parameter $\Omega^{size}_{y,z}$ is the unit size.
 41 | 
 42 | *Commitment state constraint linking start-up and shut-down decisions*
 43 | 
 44 | Additionally, the following constarint maintains the commitment state variable across time, $\nu_{y,z,t}$, as the sum of the commitment state in the prior, $\nu_{y,z,t-1}$, period plus the number of units started in the current period, $\chi_{y,z,t}$, less the number of units shut down in the current period, $\zeta_{y,z,t}$:
 45 | 
 46 | ```math
 47 | \begin{aligned}
 48 | &\nu_{y,z,t} =\nu_{y,z,t-1} + \chi_{y,z,t} - \zeta_{y,z,t}
 49 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}^{interior} \\
 50 | &\nu_{y,z,t} =\nu_{y,z,t +\tau^{period}-1} + \chi_{y,z,t} - \zeta_{y,z,t}
 51 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}^{start}
 52 | \end{aligned}
 53 | ```
 54 | (See Constraint 4 in the code)

 56 | Like other time-coupling constraints, this constraint wraps around to link the commitment state in the first time step of the year (or each representative period), $t \in \mathcal{T}^{start}$, to the last time step of the year (or each representative period), $t+\tau^{period}-1$.
 57 | 
 58 | **Ramping constraints**
 59 | 
 60 | Thermal resources subject to unit commitment ($y \in UC$) adhere to the following ramping constraints on hourly changes in power output:
 61 | 
 62 | ```math
 63 | \begin{aligned}
 64 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t-1} + f_{y, z, t-1}+r_{y, z, t-1} - \Theta_{y,z,t}-f_{y, z, t}&\leq  \kappa^{down}_{y,z} \cdot \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \cdot (\nu_{y,z,t} - \chi_{y,z,t}) & \\[6pt]
 65 | 	\qquad & - \: \rho^{min}_{y,z} \cdot \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \chi_{y,z,t} & \hspace{0.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}  \\[6pt]
 66 | 	\qquad & + \: \text{min}( \rho^{max}_{y,z,t}, \text{max}( \rho^{min}_{y,z}, \kappa^{down}_{y,z} ) ) \cdot \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \zeta_{y,z,t} &
 67 | \end{aligned}
 68 | ```
 69 | 
 70 | ```math
 71 | \begin{aligned}
 72 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t}+f_{y, z, t}+r_{y, z, t} - \Theta_{y,z,t-1}- f_{y, z, t-1} &\leq  \kappa^{up}_{y,z} \cdot \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \cdot (\nu_{y,z,t} - \chi_{y,z,t}) & \\[6pt]
 73 | 	\qquad & + \: \text{min}( \rho^{max}_{y,z,t}, \text{max}( \rho^{min}_{y,z}, \kappa^{up}_{y,z} ) ) \cdot \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \chi_{y,z,t} & \hspace{0.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T} \\[6pt]
 74 | 	\qquad & - \: \rho^{min}_{y,z} \cdot \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \zeta_{y,z,t} &
 75 | \end{aligned}
 76 | ```
 77 | (See Constraints 5-6 in the code)
 78 | 
 79 | where decision $\Theta_{y,z,t}$, $f_{y, z, t}$, and $r_{y, z, t}$ are respectively, the energy injected into the grid, regulation, and reserve by technology $y$ in zone $z$ at time $t$, parameter $\kappa_{y,z,t}^{up|down}$ is the maximum ramp-up or ramp-down rate as a percentage of installed capacity, parameter $\rho_{y,z}^{min}$ is the minimum stable power output per unit of installed capacity, and parameter $\rho_{y,z,t}^{max}$ is the maximum available generation per unit of installed capacity. These constraints account for the ramping limits for committed (online) units as well as faster changes in power enabled by units starting or shutting down in the current time step.
 80 | 
 81 | **Minimum and maximum power output**
 82 | 
 83 | If not modeling regulation and spinning reserves, thermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints that ensure power output does not exceed minimum and maximum feasible levels:
 84 | 
 85 | ```math
 86 | \begin{aligned}
 87 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t} \geq \rho^{min}_{y,z} \times \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \times \nu_{y,z,t}
 88 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 89 | \end{aligned}
 90 | ```
 91 | 
 92 | ```math
 93 | \begin{aligned}
 94 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t} \leq \rho^{max}_{y,z} \times \Omega^{size}_{y,z} \times \nu_{y,z,t}
 95 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
 96 | \end{aligned}
 97 | ```
 98 | 
 99 | (See Constraints 7-8 the code)
100 | 
101 | If modeling reserves and regulation, these constraints are replaced by those established in this ```thermal_commit_operational_reserves()```.
102 | 
103 | **Minimum and maximum up and down time**
104 | 
105 | Thermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints on the minimum time steps after start-up before a unit can shutdown again (minimum up time) and the minimum time steps after shut-down before a unit can start-up again (minimum down time):
106 | 
107 | ```math
108 | \begin{aligned}
109 | 	\nu_{y,z,t} \geq \displaystyle \sum_{\hat{t} = t-(\tau^{up}_{y,z}-1)}^t \chi_{y,z,\hat{t}}
110 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
111 | \end{aligned}
112 | ```
113 | 
114 | ```math
115 | \begin{aligned}
116 | 	\frac{\overline{\Delta_{y,z}} + \Omega_{y,z} - \Delta_{y,z}}{\Omega^{size}_{y,z}} -  \nu_{y,z,t} \geq \displaystyle \sum_{\hat{t} = t-(\tau^{down}_{y,z}-1)}^t \zeta_{y,z,\hat{t}}
117 | 	\hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
118 | \end{aligned}
119 | ```
120 | (See Constraints 9-10 in the code)
121 | 
122 | where $\tau_{y,z}^{up|down}$ is the minimum up or down time for units in generating cluster $y$ in zone $z$.
123 | 
124 | Like with the ramping constraints, the minimum up and down constraint time also wrap around from the start of each time period to the end of each period.
125 | It is recommended that users of GenX must use longer subperiods than the longest min up/down time if modeling UC. Otherwise, the model will report error.

268 | 
269 | This function is called by the ```thermal_commit()``` function when regulation and reserves constraints are active and defines reserve related constraints for thermal power plants subject to unit commitment constraints on power plant start-ups and shut-down decisions.
270 | 
271 | **Maximum contributions to frequency regulation and reserves**
272 | 
273 | When modeling frequency regulation and reserves contributions, thermal units subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints which limit the maximum contribution to regulation and reserves in each time step to a specified maximum fraction ($,\upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z}$) of the commitment capacity in that time step ($(\Omega^{size}_{y,z} \cdot \nu_{y,z,t})$):
274 | 
275 | ```math
276 | \begin{aligned}
277 | 	f_{y,z,t} \leq \upsilon^{reg}_{y,z} \times \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} (\Omega^{size}_{y,z} \times \nu_{y,z,t}) \hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
278 | \end{aligned}
279 | ```
280 | 
281 | ```math
282 | \begin{aligned}
283 | 	r_{y,z,t} \leq \upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z} \times \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} (\Omega^{size}_{y,z} \times \nu_{y,z,t}) \hspace{1.5cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
284 | \end{aligned}
285 | ```
286 | 
287 | where $f_{y,z,t}$ is the frequency regulation contribution limited by the maximum regulation contribution $\upsilon^{reg}_{y,z}$, and $r_{y,z,t}$ is the reserves contribution limited by the maximum reserves contribution $\upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z}$. Limits on reserve contributions reflect the maximum ramp rate for the thermal resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.
288 | 
289 | **Minimum and maximum power output**
290 | 
291 | When modeling frequency regulation and spinning reserves contributions, thermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints that ensure the sum of power output and reserve and/or regulation contributions do not exceed minimum and maximum feasible power output:
292 | 
293 | ```math

102 | 
103 | This function is called by the ```thermal_no_commit()``` function when regulation and reserves constraints are active and defines reserve related constraints for thermal power plants not subject to unit commitment constraints on power plant start-ups and shut-down decisions.
104 | 
105 | **Maximum contributions to frequency regulation and reserves**
106 | 
107 | Thermal units not subject to unit commitment adhere instead to the following constraints on maximum reserve and regulation contributions:
108 | 
109 | ```math
110 | \begin{aligned}
111 | 	f_{y,z,t} \leq \upsilon^{reg}_{y,z} \times \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z} \hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{H \setminus UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
112 | \end{aligned}
113 | ```
114 | 
115 | ```math
116 | \begin{aligned}
117 | 	r_{y,z,t} \leq \upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z} \times \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z} \hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{H \setminus UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
118 | \end{aligned}
119 | ```
120 | 
121 | where $f_{y,z,t}$ is the frequency regulation contribution limited by the maximum regulation contribution $\upsilon^{reg}_{y,z}$, and $r_{y,z,t}$ is the reserves contribution limited by the maximum reserves contribution $\upsilon^{rsv}_{y,z}$. Limits on reserve contributions reflect the maximum ramp rate for the thermal resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.
122 | 
123 | **Minimum and maximum power output**
124 | 
125 | When modeling regulation and spinning reserves, thermal units not subject to unit commitment are bound by the following limits on maximum and minimum power output:
126 | 
127 | ```math
128 | \begin{aligned}
129 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t} - f_{y,z,t} \geq \rho^{min}_{y,z} \times \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z}
130 | 	\hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{H \setminus UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
131 | \end{aligned}
132 | ```
133 | 
134 | ```math
135 | \begin{aligned}
136 | 	\Theta_{y,z,t} + f_{y,z,t} + r_{y,z,t} \leq \rho^{max}_{y,z,t} \times \Delta^{\text{total}}_{y,z}
137 | 	\hspace{1cm} \forall y \in \mathcal{H \setminus UC}, \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, \forall t \in \mathcal{T}
138 | \end{aligned}
139 | ```
140 | 
141 | Note there are multiple versions of these constraints in the code in order to avoid creation of unecessary constraints and decision variables for thermal units unable to provide regulation and/or reserves contributions due to input parameters (e.g. ```Reg_Max=0``` and/or ```RSV_Max=0```).

 72 | 
 73 | 4) When NetworkExpansion is active and there are multiple model zones, parameters related to transmission and network expansion are updated. First, annualized transmission reinforcement costs are converted into overnight capital costs. Next, the maximum allowable transmission line reinforcement parameter is overwritten by the model stage-specific value specified in the "Line\_Max\_Flow\_Possible\_MW" fields in the network\_multi\_stage.csv file. Finally, internal representations of lines eligible or not eligible for transmission expansion are overwritten based on the updated maximum allowable transmission line reinforcement parameters.

574 | ```math
575 | \begin{aligned}
576 |     OBJ^{*} = DF * OPEXMULT * OBJ + \alpha
577 | \end{aligned}
578 | ```
579 | where $OBJ$ is the original objective function. $OBJ$ is scaled by two terms. The first is a discount factor (applied only in the non-myopic case), which discounts costs associated with the model stage $p$ to year-0 dollars:
580 | ```math
581 | \begin{aligned}
582 |     DF = \frac{1}{(1+WACC)^{\sum^{(p-1)}_{k=0}L_{k}}}
583 | \end{aligned}
584 | ```
585 | where $WACC$ is the weighted average cost of capital, and $L_{p}$ is the length of each stage in years (both set in multi\_stage\_settings.yml)
586 | 
587 | The second term is a discounted sum of annual operational expenses incurred each year of a multi-year model stage:
588 | ```math
589 | \begin{aligned}
590 |     & OPEXMULT = \sum^{L}_{l=1}\frac{1}{(1+WACC)^{l-1}}
591 | \end{aligned}
592 | ```
593 | Note that although the objective function contains investment costs, which occur only once and thus do not need to be scaled by OPEXMULT, these costs are multiplied by a factor of $\frac{1}{WACC}$ before being added to the objective function in investment\_discharge\_multi\_stage(), investment\_charge\_multi\_stage(), investment\_energy\_multi\_stage(), and transmission\_multi\_stage(). Thus, this step scales these costs back to their correct value.
594 | 
595 | The cost-to-go function $\alpha$ represents an approximation of future costs given the investment and retirement decisions in the current stage. It is constructed through the addition of cuts to the cost-to-go function $\alpha$ during the backwards pass.

  3 | #  TIME DOMAIN REDUCTION SETTINGS
  4 | #
  5 | #  Set parameters here that organize how your full timeseries
  6 | #   data will be divided into representative period clusters.
  7 | #   Ensure that time_domain_reduction is set to 1 in GenX_settings.yml
  8 | #   before running. Run within GenX or use PreCluster.jl to test and
  9 | #   examine representative period output before proceeding.
 10 | #   Specify your data input directory as inpath within Run_test.jl
 11 | #   or PreCluster.jl.
 12 | #
 13 | #####
 14 | 
 15 |   #   - TimestepsPerRepPeriod
 16 |   #   Typically 168 timesteps (e.g., hours) per period, this designates
 17 |   #   the length of each representative period.
 18 | TimestepsPerRepPeriod: 168
 19 | 
 20 |   #   - ClusterMethod
 21 |   #   Either 'kmeans' or 'kmedoids', this designates the method used to cluster
 22 |   #   periods and determine each point's representative period.
 23 | ClusterMethod: 'kmeans'
 24 | 
 25 |   #   - ScalingMethod
 26 |   #   Either 'N' or 'S', this designates directs the module to normalize ([0,1])
 27 |   #   or standardize (mean 0, variance 1) the input data.
 28 | ScalingMethod: "S"
 29 | 
 30 |   #   - MaxPeriods
 31 |   #   The maximum number of periods - both clustered periods and extreme periods -
 32 |   #   that may be used to represent the input data. If IterativelyAddPeriods is on and the
 33 |   #   error threshold is never met, this will be the total number of periods.
 34 | MaxPeriods: 11
 35 | 
 36 |   #   - MinPeriods
 37 |   #   The minimum number of periods used to represent the input data. If using
 38 |   #   UseExtremePeriods, this must be at least the number of extreme periods requests. If
 39 |   #   IterativelyAddPeriods if off, this will be the total number of periods.
 40 | MinPeriods: 8
 41 | 
 42 |   #   - IterativelyAddPeriods
 43 |   #   Either 'yes' or 'no', this designates whether or not to add periods
 44 |   #   until the error threshold between input data and represented data is met or the maximum
 45 |   #   number of periods is reached.
 46 | IterativelyAddPeriods: 1
 47 | 
 48 |   #   - IterateMethod
 49 |   #   Either 'cluster' or 'extreme', this designates whether to add clusters to
 50 |   #   the kmeans/kmedoids method or to set aside the worst-fitting periods as a new extreme periods.
 51 |   #   The default option is 'cluster'.
 52 | IterateMethod: "cluster"
 53 | 
 54 |   #   - Threshold
 55 |   #   Iterative period addition will end if the period farthest (Euclidean Distance)
 56 |   #   from its representative period is within this percentage of the total possible error (for normalization)
 57 |   #   or ~95% of the total possible error (for standardization). E.g., for a threshold of 0.01,
 58 |   #   every period must be within 1% of the spread of possible error before the clustering
 59 |   #   iterations will terminate (or until the max number of periods is reached).
 60 | Threshold: 0.05
 61 | 
 62 |   #   - nReps
 63 |   #   The number of times to repeat each kmeans/kmedoids clustering at the same setting.
 64 | nReps: 100
 65 | 
 66 |   #   - DemandWeight
 67 |   #   Default 1, this is an optional multiplier on demand columns in order to prioritize
 68 |   #   better fits for demand profiles over resource capacity factor profiles.
 69 | DemandWeight: 1
 70 | 
 71 |   #   - WeightTotal
 72 |   #   Default 8760, the sum to which the relative weights of representative periods will be scaled.
 73 | WeightTotal: 8760
 74 | 
 75 |   #   - ClusterFuelPrices
 76 |   #   Either 1 (yes) or 0 (no), this indicates whether or not to use the fuel price
 77 |   #   time series in Fuels_data.csv in the clustering process. If 0, this function will still write
 78 |   #   Fuels_data_clustered.csv with reshaped fuel prices based on the number and size of the
 79 |   #   representative weeks, assuming a constant time series of fuel prices with length equal to the
 80 |   #   number of timesteps in the raw input data.
 81 | ClusterFuelPrices: 1
 82 | 
 83 |   #   - UseExtremePeriods
 84 |   #   Either 'yes' or 'no', this designates whether or not to include
 85 |   #   outliers (by performance or demand/resource extreme) as their own representative periods.
 86 |   #   This setting automatically includes the periods with maximum demand, minimum solar cf and
 87 |   #   minimum wind cf as extreme periods.
 88 | UseExtremePeriods: 1
 89 | 
 90 |   #   - MultiStageConcatenate
 91 |   #   (Only considered if MultiStage = 1 in genx_settings.yml)
 92 |   #   If 1, this designates that the model should time domain reduce the input data
 93 |   #   of all model stages together. Else if 0, the model will time domain reduce each
 94 |   #   stage separately
 95 | MultiStageConcatenate: 0
 96 | 
 97 | # STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - Currently just uses integral max demand, integral min PV and wind.
 98 | #   - ExtremePeriods
 99 | #   Use this to define which periods to be included among the final representative periods
100 | #   as "Extreme Periods".
101 | #   Select by profile type: demand ("Demand"), solar PV capacity factors ("PV"), and wind capacity factors ("Wind").
102 | #   Select whether to examine these profiles by zone ("Zone") or across the whole system ("System").
103 | #   Select whether to look for absolute max/min at the timestep level ("Absolute")

/test/fusion_pulse_every_hour/README.md:

 1 | # Fusion test case without pulse behavior
 2 | 
 3 | These fusion plants have
 4 | - 0.2 passive parasitic power factor
 5 | - 0.1 active parasitic power factor
 6 | - 0.05 start energy parasitic power factor, estart
 7 | - a 1 hour max pulse time (pulsing every hour), τpu
 8 | - 0.125 hour dwell time, τdw
 9 | 
10 | Their nominal "active fraction" is f_act = 1 - τdw / τpu = 0.875
11 | 
12 | Their nominal "core net capacity factor" is
13 | f_netavgcap = f_act (1 - f_{parasitic,act}) - f_{parasitic,pass} - estart / τpu = 0.5375
14 | 
15 | Therefore in a linear model, a steady-state demand of 1000MW will require a peak gross capacity of 1860.47 MW, which we see in capacity.csv.
16 | See also that `fusion_net_capacity.csv` has 1000 MW of NetCapacity.
17 | The maximum hourly gross energy output is f_act * 1860.47 = 1627.91, seen in power_balance.csv.
18 | The parasitic power will be 1860.47 * (f_act * f_{parasitic,act} + f_{parasitic,pass} + estart) = 627.91 MW.
19 | The net power generation then equals the demand of 1000 MW.
20 | 
21 | The plants require 8 hours of maintenance every other "day". (every 2 "years" in the input)
22 | In this example, plants have half of their normal passive parasitic power when under maintenance, or 0.1 of the gross capacity.
23 | 
24 | During the 8 lull hours the demand is 300MW.
25 | 558.14 MW of plants are needed to support the load of 300 MW, since 558.14 * fnetavgcap = 300
26 | To find the number of plants m that can go down for maintenance, solve:
27 | 
28 | 1000 - m 100 fnetavgcap = 300 + 0.1 100 m
29 | 
30 | where m is the number of plants and the cap_size is 100.
31 | This reduces to m = 10.98, which is what we see in `maint_down.csv`.
32 | 
33 | Therefore 762.43 MW (gross capacity) of plants do *not* go down for maintenance; they produce fact * 762.42 = 667.12 MW, as seen in power_balance.csv.
34 | 
35 | The parasitic load during these hours is 10.98 * 0.1 * 100 + 762.42 * (fact * ra + rp + estart) = 367.12, which we see in power_balance.csv.
36 | 
37 | Calculate total objective
38 | -------------------------
39 | The investment cost is 100000 per MW, so 1860.47 * 100000 = 1.860e8
40 | Each day the gross generation is 667.12 * 8 + 1626.91 * 16 and there are 365 per year, for a variable O&M cost of 1.1455e8
41 | The total objective is then 3.0059626e8.
